        "content": "Customer engagement is a marketing and strategic management concept. Practitioners view it as interactions, \"engagements\", between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state that “occurs by virtue of interactive customer experiences with a focal agent/object”, where focal agent/object can be any type of organization and/or its offerings such as branded products or services. As such, customer engagement is seen as a customer’s motivationally driven, volitional cognitive, emotional, and behavioral investments into interactions with such a focal agent/object.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nIn March 2006, the Advertising Research Foundation announced the first definition of customer engagement as \"turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context.\" However, the ARF definition was criticized by some for being too broad. The ARF, World Federation of Advertisers,  Various definitions have translated different aspects of customer engagement. Forrester Consulting's research in 2008, has defined customer engagement as \"creating deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time\". Studies by the Economist Intelligence Unit result in defining customer engagement as, \"an intimate long-term relationship with the customer\". Both of these concepts prescribe that customer engagement is attributed to a rich association formed with customers. With aspects of relationship marketing and service-dominant perspectives, customer engagement can be loosely defined as \"consumers' proactive contributions in co-creating their personalized experiences and perceived value with organizations through active, explicit, and ongoing dialogue and interactions\". The book, Best Digital Marketing Campaigns In The World, defines customer engagement as, \"mutually beneficial relationships with a constantly growing community of online consumers\". The various definitions of customer engagement are diversified by different perspectives and contexts of the engagement process. These are determined by the brand, product, or service, the audience profile, attitudes and behaviours, and messages and channels of communication that are used to interact with the customer.\nSince 2009, a number of new definitions have been proposed in the literature. In 2011, the term was defined as \"the level of a customer’s cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions,\" and identifies the three CE dimensions of immersion (cognitive), passion (emotional) and activation (behavioral). It was also defined as \"a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive, co-creative customer experiences with a particular agent/object (e.g. a brand)\". Researchers have based their work on customer engagement as a multi-dimensional construct, while also identifying that it is context-dependent. Engagement gets manifested in the various interactions that customers undertake, which in turn get shaped up by individual cultures. The context is not limited to geographical context, but also includes the medium with which the user engages. Moreover, customer engagement is the emotional involvement and psychological process in which both new and existing consumers become loyal to specific types of services or products. The degree to which customers pay attention to companies or products, as well as their participation in operations, is referred to as customer engagement.\nAt present, practitioners view and define customer engagement as interaction between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state of the consumer.\n\n\n== Applications in Marketing ==\nMarketing practices aim to create, stimulate or influence customer behaviour, which places conversions into a more strategic context and is premised on the understanding that a focus on maximising conversions can, in some circumstances, decrease the likelihood of repeat conversions. Although customer advocacy has always been a goal for marketers, the rise of online user-generated content has directly influenced levels of advocacy. Customer engagement targets long-term interactions, encouraging customer loyalty and advocacy through word-of-mouth. Although customer engagement marketing is consistent both online and offline, the internet is the basis for marketing efforts.\n\n\n== Ethics ==\nEfforts to boost user engagement at any expense can lead to social media addiction for both service providers and users. Facebook and several other social media platforms have faced criticism for manipulating user emotions to enhance engagement, even if it is knowingly false content. Professor Hany Farid summarized Facebook’s approach, stating, “When you’re in the business of maximizing engagement, you’re not interested in truth.\" Various other techniques used to increase engagement are also considered abusive. For example, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), infinite scrolling, and incentives for users who frequently engage with the service. \n\n\n== Online customer engagement ==\nOffline customer engagement predates online, but the latter is a qualitatively different social phenomenon, unlike any offline customer engagement that social theorists or marketers recognize. In the past, customer engagement has been generated irresolutely through television, radio, media, outdoor advertising, and various other touchpoints ideally during peak and/or high trafficked allocations. However, the only conclusive results of campaigns were sales and/or return on investment figures. The widespread adoption of the internet during the late 1990s has enhanced the processes of customer engagement, in particular, the way in which it can now be measured in different ways on different levels of engagement. It is a recent social phenomenon where people engage online in communities that do not necessarily revolve around a particular product but serve as meeting or networking places. This online engagement has brought about both the empowerment of consumers and the opportunity for businesses to engage with their target customers online. A 2011 market analysis revealed that 80% of online customers, after reading negative online reviews, report making alternate purchasing decisions, while 87% of consumers said a favorable review has confirmed their decision to go through with a purchase.\nThe concept and practice of online customer engagement enables organisations to respond to the fundamental changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as to the increasing ineffectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat', broadcast model of advertising. Due to the fragmentation and specialisation of media and audiences, as well as the proliferation of community and user-generated content, businesses are increasingly losing the power to dictate the communications agenda. Simultaneously, lower switching costs, the geographical widening of the market and the vast choice of content, services and products available online have weakened customer loyalty. Enhancing customers' firm and market-related expertise has been shown to engage customers, strengthen their loyalty, and emotionally connect them more closely to a firm.\nSince the world has reached a population of over 3 billion internet users, it is conclusive that society's interactive culture is significantly influenced by technology. Connectivity is bringing consumers and organizations together, which makes it critical for companies to take advantage and focus on capturing the attention of and interacting with well-informed consumers in order to serve and satisfy them. Connecting with customers establishes exclusivity in their experience, which potentially will increase brand loyalty, and word of mouth, and provides businesses with valuable consumer analytics, insight, and retention. Customer engagement can come in the form of a view, an impression, a reach, a click, a comment, or a share, among many others. These are ways in which analytics and insights into customer engagement can now be measured on different levels, all of which are information that allows businesses to record and process results of customer engagement.\nTaking into consideration the widespread information and connections for consumers, the way to develop penetrable customer engagement is to proactively connect with customers by listening. Listening will empower the consumer, give them control, and endorse a customer-centric two-way dialogue. This dialogue will redefine the role of the consumer as they no longer assume the end user role in the process. Instead of the traditional transaction and/or exchange, the concept becomes a process of partnership between organizations and consumers. Particularly since the internet has provided consumers with the accumulation of much diverse knowledge and understanding, consumers now have increasingly high expectations, stronger sensory perceptions, and hence have become more attracted to experiential values. Therefore, it would only be profitable for businesses to submit to the new criteria, to provide the opportunity for consumers to further immerse in the consumption experience. This experience will involve organizations and consumers sharing and exchanging information, which will generate increased awareness, interest, desire to purchase, retention, and loyalty among consumers, evolving an intimate relationship. Significantly, total openness and strengthening customer service is the selling point here for customers, to make them feel more involved rather than just a number. This will earn trust, engagement, and ultimately word of mouth through endless social circles. Essentially, it is a more dynamic and transparent concept of customer relationship management (CRM).\n\n\n== Customer engagement on social media ==\nThe utilization of social media platforms has emerged as a modern way of improving customer engagement strategies. By curating content that resonates with the interests of customers, businesses cultivate authentic connections and communities online. Platforms such as Instagram and Twitter serve as useful tools for meaning dialog, enabling businesses to make lasting relationships with customers and amplify brand visibility online. \nCustomer engagement on Twitter is a form of social power and is usually measured with likes, replies and retweets.\n\n\n== Marketing value ==\nCustomer engagement marketing is necessitated by a combination of social, technological and market developments. Companies attempt to create an engaging dialogue with target consumers and stimulate their engagement with the given brand. Although this must take place both on and off-line, the internet is considered the primary method. Marketing begins with understanding the internal dynamics of these developments and the behaviour and engagement of consumers online. Consumer-generated media plays a significant role in the understanding and modeling of engagement. The control Web 2.0 consumers have gained is quantified through 'old school' marketing performance metrics.\nThe effectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat' model of advertising is decreasing, which has caused businesses to lose control of communications agendas. In August 2006, McKinsey & Co published a report which indicated that traditional TV advertising would decrease in effectiveness compared to previous decades. As customer audiences have become smaller and more specialised, the fragmentation of media, audiences and the accompanying reduction of audience size have reduced the effectiveness of the traditional top-down, mass, 'interrupt and repeat' advertising model. A Forrester Research's North American Consumer Technology Adoption Study found that people in the 18-26 age group spend more time online than watching TV. Furthermore, the Global Web Index reported that in 2021, YouTube beats any mainstream media platforms when it comes to monthly engagement. This is partly due to the fact that 51% of U.S. and U.K. consumers use YouTube for shopping and product research, a service that traditional media can't really provide.\nIn response to the fragmentation and increased amount of time spent online, marketers have also increased spending in online communication. ContextWeb analysts found marketers who promote on sites like Facebook and New York Times are not as successful at reaching consumers while marketers who promote more on niche websites have a better chance of reaching their audiences. Customer audiences are also broadcasters with the power for circulation and permanence of CGM, businesses lose influence. Rather than trying to position a product using static messages, companies can become the subject of conversation amongst a target market that has already discussed, positioned and rated the product. This also means that consumers can now choose not only when and how but, also, if they will engage with marketing communications. In addition, new media provides consumers with more control over advertising consumption.\nResearch shows the importance of customer engagement in the modern market. The lowering of entry barriers, such as the need for a sales force, access to channels and physical assets, and the geographical widening of the market due to the internet have brought about increasing competition and a decrease in brand loyalty. In combination with lower switching costs, easier access to information about products and suppliers and increased choice, brand loyalty is hard to achieve. The increasing ineffectiveness of television advertising is due to the shift of consumer attention to the internet and new media, which controls advertising consumption and causes a decrease in audience size. A study conducted by Salesforce shows an overwhelming 8% of customers acknowledge that their experience with the business is equivalent to the quality of its products or services. Therefore, it is important to prioritize customer engagement as a business strategy. \nThe proliferation of media that provide consumers with more control over their advertising consumption (subscription-based digital radio and TV) and the simultaneous decrease of trust in advertising and increase of trust in peers point to the need for communications that the customer will desire to engage with. Stimulating a consumer's engagement with a brand is the only way to increase brand loyalty and, therefore, \"the best measure of current and future performance\".\n\n\n== Consumer behavior ==\nCE behaviour became prominent with the advent of the social phenomenon of online CE. Creating and stimulating customer engagement behaviour has recently become an explicit aim of both profit and non-profit organisations in the belief that engaging target customers to a high degree is conducive to furthering business objectives.\nShevlin's definition of CE is well suited to understanding the process that leads to an engaged customer. In its adaptation by Richard Sedley the key word is 'investment'. \"Repeated interactions that strengthen the emotional, psychological or physical investment a customer has in a brand.\"\nA customer's degree of engagement with a company lies in a continuum that represents the strength of his investment in that company. Positive experiences with the company strengthen that investment and move the customer down the line of engagement.\nWhat is important in measuring degrees of involvement is the ability of defining and quantifying the stages on the continuum. One popular suggestion is a four-level model adapted from Kirkpatrick's Levels:\n\nClick – A reader arrived (current metric)\nConsume – A reader read the content\nUnderstood – A reader understood the content and remembers it\nApplied – A reader applies the content in another venue\nConcerns have, however, been expressed as regards the measurability of stages three and four.  Another popular suggestion is Ghuneim's typology of engagement.\n\nThe following consumer typology according to degree of engagement fits also into Ghuneim's continuum: creators (smallest group), critics, collectors, couch potatoes (largest group).\nEngagement is a holistic characterization of a consumer's behavior, encompassing a host of sub-aspects of behaviour such as loyalty, satisfaction, involvement, word-of-mouth advertising, complaining and more.\n\nSatisfaction: Satisfaction is simply the foundation, and the minimum requirement, for a continuing relationship with customers. Engagement extends beyond mere satisfaction.\nLoyalty – Retention: Highly engaged consumers are more loyal. Increasing the engagement of target customers increases the rate of customer retention.\nWord-of-mouth advertising – advocacy: Highly engaged customers are more likely to engage in free (for the company), credible (for their audience) word-of-mouth advertising. This can drive new customer acquisition and can have viral effects.\nAwareness – Effectiveness of communications: When customers are exposed to communication from a company that they are highly engaged with, they tend to actively elaborate on its central idea. This brings about high degrees of central processing and recall.\nFiltering: Consumers filter, categorize and rate the market from head to tail, creating multiple, overlapping folksonomies through tagging, reviewing, rating and recommending.\nComplaint-behaviour: Highly engaged customers are less likely to complain to other current or potential customers, but will address the company directly instead.\nMarketing intelligence: Highly engaged customers can give valuable recommendations for improving the quality of the offering.\nThe behavioural outcomes of an engaged consumer are what links CE to profits. From this point of view,\n\"CE is the best measure of current and future performance; an engaged relationship is probably the only guarantee for a return on your organization's or your clients' objectives.\" Simply attaining a high level of customer satisfaction does not seem to guarantee the customer's business. 60% to 80% of customers who defect to a competitor said they were satisfied or very satisfied on the survey just prior to their defection.\nThe main difference between traditional and customer engagement marketing is marked by these shifts:\n\nFrom 'reach or awareness focused' marketing communications and their metrics (GRP or pageview) towards more targeted and customised interactions that prompt the consumer to engage with and act on the content from the outset.\nFrom absolute distinctions and barriers between an organisation and its target customers towards the participation of consumers in product development, customer service and other aspects of the brand experience.\nFrom one-way, top-down, formal B2C and B2E interaction to continuing, dialogic, decentralised and personalised communications initiated by either party.\nSpecific marketing practices involve:\n\nEncouraging collaborative filtering: Google, Amazon, iTunes, Yahoo LAUNCHcast, Netflix, and Rhapsody encourage their consumers to filter, categorise and rate; that is, to market their products. They realise consumers are not only much more adept at creating highly targeted taxonomies (folksonomies) given that they are more adept at delineating the segment they themselves constitute, but, also, that they are willing to do so for free. And to the extent they cannot, they do it for them. If enough people like the band Groove Armada as well as the band The Crystal Method, there may well be a stylistic connection between them, despite the fact that one's categorised as 'downtempo' and the other 'beats and breaks'. Such strong associations tell Yahoo! to put the two on the same playlist more often, and if the positive ratings continue to come in, that connection is reinforced. Amazon does the same with their ‘customers who bought this item also bought…’ recommendations.\nCommunity development: Helping target customers develop their own communities or create new ones.\nCommunity participation: (See Communal marketing) Consumers do not filter and rate companies and their offerings within company websites only. Being able, with little effort, cost or technical skills, to create their own online localities, a large percentage of the filtering and rating takes place in non-sponsored, online spaces. Organisations must go and meet their target customers at their favoured online hangouts to not only listen but also participate in the dialogue.\nHelp consumers engage with one another: Give them content (viral podcasting, videocasting, games, v-cards etc.) they can use to engage with one another.\nSolicitation of user generated content: Engage them directly or indirectly with your product by giving them the means or incentive to create user generated content.\nCustomer self-service: Help them create a customer service FAQ in wiki or blog format. Create a blog where technical support staff and customers can communicate directly.\nProduct co-development: Create a blog where product developers and consumers can communicate directly.\nLeading by teaching: Help customers in product selection by first teaching them practically, showing them a video about product use and then help them to select the product.\n\n\n== Metrics ==\nAll marketing practices, including internet marketing, include measuring the effectiveness of various media along the customer engagement cycle, as consumers travel from awareness to purchase. Often the use of CVP Analysis factors into strategy decisions, including budgets and media placement.\nThe CE metric is useful for:\na) Planning:\n\nIdentify where CE-marketing efforts should take place; which of the communities that the target customers participate in are the most engaging?\nSpecify the way in which target customers engage, or want to engage, with the company or offering.\nb) Measuring Effectiveness: Measure how successful CE-marketing efforts have been at engaging target customers.\nThe importance of CE as a marketing metric is reflected in ARF's statement:\n\"The industry is moving toward customer engagement with marketing communications as the 21st century metric of marketing efficiency and effectiveness.\"\nARF envisages CE exclusively as a metric of engagement with communication, but it is not necessary to distinguish between engaging with the communication and with the product since CE behaviour deals with, and is influenced by, involvement with both.\nIn order to be operational, CE-metrics must be combined with psychodemographics. It is not enough to know that a website has 500 highly engaged members, for instance; it is imperative to know what percentage are members of the company's target market. As a metric for effectiveness, Scott Karp suggests, CE is the solution to the same intractable problems that have long been a struggle for old media: how to prove value.\nThe CE-metric is synthetic and integrates a number of variables. The World Federation of Advertisers calls it 'consumer-centric holistic measurement'. The following items have all been proposed as components of a CE-metric:\nRoot metrics\n\nDuration of visit\nFrequency of visit (returning to the site directly – through a URL or bookmark – or indirectly).\n% repeat visits\nRecency of visit\nDepth of visit (% of site visited)\nClick-through rate\nSales\nLifetime value\nAction metrics\n\nRSS feed subscriptions\nBookmarks, tags, ratings\nViewing of high-value or medium-value content (as valued from the organisation's point-of-view). 'Depth' of visit can be combined with this variable.\nInquiries\nProviding personal information\nDownloads\nContent resyndication\nCustomer reviews\nComments: their quality is another indicator of the degree of engagement.\nRatio between posts and comments plus trackbacks.\nIn selecting the components of a CE-metric, the following issues must be resolved:\n\nFlexible metric vs. Industry standard: According to some, CE \"measurement has never been one size fits-all\" but should vary according to industry, organisation, business goal etc. On the other hand, corporate clients and even agencies also desire some type of solid index. Internal metrics could, perhaps, be developed in addition to a comparative, industry-wide one.\nRelative weighting: The relative weighting associated with each CE-component in an algorithm. For instance, is subscribing to RSS more important than contributing a comment? If yes how much more important exactly? Relative weighting links up with the issue of flexible vs. standardised metrics: Is the relative weighting going to be solid – as will be required if the CE-metric is to be standardised – or is it going to differ depending on the industry, organisation, business goals etc.?\nComponent measurability: Most of the components of a CE-metric face problems of measurement. Duration of visit for example suffers from (a) failing to capture the most engaged users who like to peruse RSS feeds; (b) inaccuracy arising from leaving a tab open during breaks, stopping to converse with co-workers, etc.\nLength of measurement: For how long must the various CE components be measured if CE is to reflect loyalty rather than short-term, faddish engagement?\n\n\n== See also ==\nActive users\nMarketing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCheung, Christy M.K.; Shen, Xiao-Liang; Lee, Zach W.Y.; Chan, Tommy K.H.

        "content": "Technical support, commonly shortened as tech support, is a form of customer service provided to assist users in resolving problems with products such as consumer electronics and software. Technical support is typically delivered through call centers, online chat, and email services. In addition, many companies operate online forums or discussion boards where customers can provide peer-to-peer assistance, a practice shown to reduce the workload and costs of formal support channels.\n\n\n== Outsourcing tech support ==\nWith the increasing use of technology in modern times, there is a growing requirement to provide technical support. Many organizations locate their technical support departments or call centers in countries or regions with lower costs. Dell outsourced its technical support and customer service operations to India in 2001; some of these jobs were later moved back to the United States. There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations, often referred to as Managed Service Providers (MSPs).\nFor businesses needing to provide technical support, outsourcing allows them to maintain high availability of service, especially during peak demand or product launches. Such arrangements may reduce operational costs and enable core employees to focus on primary responsibilities. It also provides access to specialized personnel with technical expertise beyond the internal workforce.\n\n\n== Multi-level tech support ==\nTechnical support is often subdivided into tiers, or levels, in order to better serve a business or customer base. The number of levels a business uses to organize their technical support group is dependent on the business's needs regarding their ability to sufficiently serve their customers or users. The purpose of a multi-tiered support system is to improve efficiency by matching issue complexity with technician expertise. Success of the organizational structure is dependent on the technicians' understanding of their level of responsibility and commitments, their customer response time commitments, and when to appropriately escalate an issue and to which level. A common support structure revolves around a three-tiered technical support system. Remote computer repair is a method for troubleshooting software related problems via remote desktop connections.  \n\n\n=== L1 Support ===\nTier I (or Level 1, abbreviated as T1 or L1) is the first technical support level. The first job of a Tier I specialist is to gather the customer's information and to determine the customer's issue by analyzing the symptoms and figuring out the underlying problem. When analyzing the symptoms, it is important for the technician to identify what the customer is trying to accomplish so that time is not wasted on \"attempting to solve a symptom instead of a problem.\"\nOnce identification of the underlying problem is established, the specialist can begin sorting through the possible solutions available. Technical support specialists in this group typically handle straightforward and simple problems while \"possibly using some kind of knowledge management tool.\" This includes troubleshooting methods such as verifying physical layer issues, resolving username and password problems, uninstalling/reinstalling basic software applications, verification of proper hardware and software set up, and assistance with navigating around application menus. Personnel at this level have a basic to general understanding of the product or service and may not always have the expertise for complex issues. They are expected to resolve most straightforward problems, typically 70–80% of reported cases.\n\n\n=== L2 Support ===\nTier II (or Level 2, abbreviated as T2 or L2) is a more in-depth technical support level than Tier I and therefore costs more as the technicians are more experienced and knowledgeable on a particular product or service. It is synonymous with level 2 support, support line 2, administrative level support, and various other headings denoting advanced technical troubleshooting and analysis methods. Technicians in this realm of knowledge are responsible for assisting Tier I personnel in solving basic technical problems and for investigating elevated issues by confirming the validity of the problem and seeking for known solutions related to these more complex issues. However, prior to the troubleshooting process, it is important that the technician review the work order to see what has already been accomplished by the Tier I technician and how long the technician has been working with the particular customer. This is a key element in meeting both the customer and business needs as it allows the technician to prioritize the troubleshooting process and properly manage their time.\nIf a problem is new and/or personnel from this group cannot determine a solution, they are responsible for elevating this issue to the Tier III technical support group. In addition, many companies may specify that certain troubleshooting solutions be performed by this group to help ensure the intricacies of a challenging issue are solved by providing experienced and knowledgeable technicians. This may include, but is not limited to, onsite installations or replacement of various hardware components, software repair, diagnostic testing, or the utilization of remote control tools to take over the user's machine for the sole purpose of troubleshooting and finding a solution to the problem.\n\n\n=== L3 Support ===\nTier III (or Level 3, abbreviated as T3 or L3) is the highest level of support in a three-tiered technical support model responsible for handling the most difficult or advanced problems. It is synonymous with level 3 support, 3rd line support, back-end support, support line 3, high-end support, and various other headings denoting expert level troubleshooting and analysis methods. These individuals are subject-matter experts who support both Tier I and II personnel and contribute to developing solutions for new or previously unresolved issues. Note that Tier III technicians have the same responsibility as Tier II technicians in reviewing the work order and assessing the time already spent with the customer so that the work is prioritized and time management is sufficiently utilized. If it is at all possible, the technician will work to solve the problem with the customer as it may become apparent that the Tier I and/or Tier II technicians simply failed to discover the proper solution. Upon encountering new problems, however, Tier III personnel must first determine whether or not to solve the problem and may require the customer's contact information so that the technician can have adequate time to troubleshoot the issue and find a solution. It is typical for a developer or someone who knows the code or backend of the product, to be the Tier 3 support person.\nIn some instances, an issue may be so problematic to the point where the product cannot be salvaged and must be replaced. Such extreme problems are also sent to the original developers for in-depth analysis. If it is determined that a problem can be solved, this group is responsible for designing and developing one or more courses of action, evaluating each of these courses in a test case environment, and implementing the best solution to the problem.\n\n\n=== L4 Support ===\nWhile not universally used, a fourth level often represents an escalation point beyond the organization. L4 support is generally a hardware or software vendor.\n\n\n== Scams ==\n\nA common scam typically involves a cold caller claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like Microsoft. These scams have often originated from call centers in various countries targeting users in English-speaking regions, though increasingly they also operate domestically. The scammer will instruct the user to download a remote desktop program and once connected, use social engineering techniques that typically involve Windows components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victim's credit card.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCall center\nCall board\nCustomer service\nComparison of issue-tracking systems\nComparison of help desk issue tracking software\nHelp desk\nHelp desk software\nCustomer support\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Customer success is a business methodology and organizational function focused on ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes while using a company's products or services. The discipline emerged in the early 2000s alongside the growth of software as a service (SaaS) and subscription-based business models, where ongoing customer satisfaction directly impacts recurring revenue.\nUnlike traditional customer service, which typically responds to customer issues reactively, customer success takes a proactive approach to ensure customers realize value from their investments. The methodology encompasses strategic planning, relationship management, and data-driven interventions designed to reduce customer churn, increase customer lifetime value, and drive expansion revenue.\nCustomer success has evolved from a support function to a strategic business discipline, with dedicated teams, specialized technology platforms, and established career paths. Research indicates that companies with mature customer success programs achieve 12% higher revenue growth and 19% higher gross margins compared to those without formal customer success initiatives.\n\n\n== Definition and core principles ==\nCustomer success is defined as the business methodology that ensures customers achieve their desired outcomes while using a company's products or services. The approach is built on several core principles:\nProactive engagement: Customer success teams identify potential issues and opportunities before they impact the customer relationship. This contrasts with reactive customer service models that address problems after they occur.\nOutcome-focused approach: Rather than focusing solely on product usage, customer success emphasizes helping customers achieve their business objectives. This alignment creates stronger customer relationships and increases the likelihood of contract renewals and expansions.\nData-driven decision making: Customer success relies heavily on customer data, usage analytics, and health scoring to identify at-risk accounts and expansion opportunities. This quantitative approach enables scalable customer management across large customer bases.\n\n\n== History and evolution ==\n\n\n=== Origins in software industry ===\nThe customer success discipline emerged in the early 2000s as software as a service (SaaS) companies recognized fundamental differences between traditional software sales and subscription-based models. In traditional enterprise software, customers paid large upfront license fees regardless of actual usage or satisfaction. The SaaS model's recurring revenue structure created a direct correlation between customer satisfaction and business success.\nEarly pioneers including Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow developed customer success functions to address the unique challenges of subscription businesses. These companies recognized that acquiring customers was only the first step; ensuring ongoing value realization became critical for sustainable growth.\n\n\n=== Expansion beyond SaaS ===\nBy 2010, customer success methodologies began expanding beyond technology companies. Traditional industries including financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing adopted customer success principles to improve customer retention and drive growth in competitive markets.\nThe 2020s saw further evolution with the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, enabling more sophisticated customer health monitoring and predictive analytics. Companies began using these tools to identify expansion opportunities and prevent churn at scale.\n\n\n== Customer success frameworks ==\n\n\n=== Engagement models ===\nCustomer success organizations typically employ three primary engagement models based on customer value and complexity:\nHigh-touch model: Assigned customer success managers provide personalized, one-to-one support for high-value enterprise clients. This model involves regular strategic business reviews, executive relationship management, and custom success planning.\nLow-touch model: Automated and digital-first approaches serve smaller customers through self-service resources, automated communications, and scalable programs. This model relies heavily on product-led growth strategies and in-app guidance.\nHybrid model: Combines elements of both high-touch and low-touch approaches, typically segmenting customers by value, complexity, or strategic importance. This model optimizes resource allocation while maintaining appropriate service levels across customer segments.\n\n\n=== Customer journey mapping ===\nSuccessful customer success programs map distinct phases of the customer lifecycle:\nOnboarding: Initial product setup, training, and early value realization. Research shows that customers who achieve early success are 5x more likely to become long-term advocates.\nAdoption: Expanding product usage and feature adoption across the customer organization. This phase focuses on driving deeper engagement and demonstrating continued value.\nExpansion: Identifying opportunities for account growth through additional products, services, or user licenses. Customer success teams typically own or significantly influence expansion revenue targets.\nAdvocacy: Converting satisfied customers into references, case studies, and referral sources. Customer advocates provide social proof and reduce customer acquisition costs.\n\n\n== Roles and organizational structure ==\n\n\n=== Customer success manager ===\nThe customer success manager (CSM) serves as the primary customer advocate within the vendor organization. CSMs are responsible for understanding customer business objectives, monitoring product usage and satisfaction, and coordinating internal resources to ensure customer success.\nKey responsibilities include:\n\nDeveloping customer success plans aligned with business objectives\nConducting regular business reviews and strategic planning sessions\nIdentifying and mitigating risks that could lead to customer churn\nRecognizing expansion opportunities and coordinating with sales teams\nServing as the voice of the customer within the organization\n\n\n=== Customer success leadership ===\nCustomer success leadership roles have evolved to include strategic positions such as Chief Customer Officer (CCO), Vice President of Customer Success, and Director of Customer Experience. These roles are responsible for developing customer success strategy, managing organizational resources, and demonstrating measurable business impact.\nCustomer success leaders typically report to executive leadership and are accountable for metrics including customer retention rates, expansion revenue, and customer lifetime value. The role requires cross-functional collaboration with sales, marketing, product development, and support teams.\n\n\n== Metrics and measurement ==\n\n\n=== Key performance indicators ===\nCustomer success organizations rely on several key metrics to measure effectiveness and business impact:\nCustomer health score: Composite metric combining product usage, support ticket volume, payment history, and engagement levels. Health scores enable proactive intervention for at-risk accounts.\nNet Promoter Score (NPS): Measures customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend the product or service. NPS serves as a leading indicator of customer satisfaction and potential churn.\nCustomer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Measures short-term customer satisfaction with specific interactions or experiences. CSAT provides immediate feedback on customer success program effectiveness.\nGross Revenue Retention (GRR): Measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, excluding expansion revenue. GRR indicates the effectiveness of churn prevention efforts.\nNet Revenue Retention (NRR): Measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, including expansion revenue. NRR above 100% indicates net customer growth.\nTime to Value (TTV): is a key customer success metric, measuring the interval from onboarding to the first realization of value by the customer. Faster TTV correlates with improved client satisfaction and retention\n\n\n== Technology and tools ==\n\n\n=== Customer success platforms ===\nSpecialized customer success platforms have emerged to support scalable customer management. These platforms integrate customer data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive customer views and enable automated interventions.\nLeading platforms include capabilities for:\n\nCustomer health monitoring and predictive analytics\nAutomated customer communication and outreach\nSuccess plan development and tracking\nIntegration with customer relationship management and support systems\nReporting and analytics for customer success metrics\n\n\n=== Data integration and analytics ===\nModern customer success relies heavily on data integration across customer touchpoints. Organizations combine product usage data, support interactions, financial information, and external data sources to create comprehensive customer profiles.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence technologies enable predictive customer success, identifying at-risk accounts and expansion opportunities before they become apparent through traditional metrics.\n\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n\n=== Business outcomes ===\nCompanies with mature customer success programs demonstrate superior financial performance across multiple metrics. Research indicates that organizations with dedicated customer success teams achieve:\n\n12% higher revenue growth rates\n19% higher gross margins\n15% higher customer retention rates\n25% higher customer lifetime value\n\n\n=== Market evolution ===\nThe customer success industry has experienced significant growth, with the global customer success software market projected to reach $1.2 billion by 2025. This growth reflects increasing recognition of customer success as a strategic business discipline rather than a support function.\nProfessional organizations such as the Customer Success Association and Customer Success Network have emerged to support practitioners with training, certification, and best practice sharing. These organizations have established customer success as a recognized professional discipline with defined career paths and competency frameworks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer relationship management\nCustomer service\nSoftware as a service\nCustomer experience\nChurn rate\nCustomer lifetime value\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCustomer Success Association\nCustomer Success Network",

        "content": "Customer service is the assistance and advice provided by a company to those who buy or use its products or services, either in person or remotely. Customer service is often practiced in a way that reflects the strategies and values of a firm, and levels vary according to the industry. Good quality customer service is usually measured through customer retention. Successful customer service interactions are dependent on employees \"who can adjust themselves to the personality of the customer\".\nCustomer service in some cases is part of the firm's intangible assets and can differentiate it from others in the industry. One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization. It is expected that AI-based chatbots will significantly impact customer service and call centre roles and will increase productivity substantially. Many organisations have already adopted AI chatbots to improve their customer service experience.\nThe evolution in the service industry has identified the needs of consumers. Companies usually create policies or standards to guide their personnel to follow their particular service package. A service package is a combination of tangible and intangible characteristics a firm uses to take care of its clients.\n\n\n== Customer support ==\n\nCustomer support is a range of consumer services to assist customers in making cost-effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product. These services may even be provided at the place in which the customer makes use of the product or service. In this case, it is called \"at home customer service\" or \"at home customer support.\" Customer support is an effective strategy that ensures that the customer's needs have been attended to. Customer support helps ensure that the products and services that have been provided to the customer meet their expectations. When receiving an effective and efficient customer support experience, customers tend to be loyal to the organization, which creates a competitive advantage over its competitors. Organizations should ensure that any complaints from customers about customer support have been dealt with effectively.\n\n\n== Automation and productivity increase ==\nCustomer service may be provided in person (e.g. sales / service representative), or by automated means, such as kiosks, websites, and apps. An advantage of automation is that it can provide service 24 hours a day which can complement face-to-face customer service. There is also economic benefit to the firm. Through the evolution of technology, automated services become less expensive over time. This helps provide services to more customers for a fraction of the cost of employees' wages. Automation can facilitate customer service or replace it entirely.\nA popular type of automated customer service is done through artificial intelligence (AI). The customer benefit of AI is the feel for chatting with a live agent through improved speech technologies while giving customers the self-service benefit.  AI can learn through interaction to give a personalized service. The exchange the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates within devices, lets us transfer data when we need it, where we need it. Each gadget catches the information it needs while it maintains communication with other devices. This is also done through advances in hardware and software technology. Another form of automated customer service is touch-tone phone, which usually involves IVR (Interactive Voice Response) a main menu and the use of a keypad as options (e.g. \"Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Spanish\").\nIn the Internet era, a challenge is to maintain and/or enhance the personal experience while making use of the efficiencies of online commerce. \"Online customers are literally invisible to you (and you to them), so it's easy to shortchange them emotionally. But this lack of visual and tactile presence makes it even more crucial to create a sense of personal, human-to-human connection in the online arena.\"\n\nExamples of customer service by artificial means are automated online assistants that can be seen as avatars on websites, which enterprises can use to reduce operating and training costs. These are driven by chatbots, and a major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing. \n\n\n== Metrics ==\nThe two primary methods of gathering feedback are customer surveys and Net Promoter Score measurement, used for calculating the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer.\n\n\n== Instant feedback ==\nMany outfits have implemented feedback loops that allow them to capture feedback at the point of experience. For example, National Express in the UK has invited passengers to send text messages while riding the bus. This has been shown to be useful, as it allows companies to improve their customer service before the customer defects, thus making it far more likely that the customer will return next time.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n \n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKrishnan, C., Gupta, A., Gupta, A., Singh, G.

        "content": "Customer engagement is a marketing and strategic management concept. Practitioners view it as interactions, \"engagements\", between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state that “occurs by virtue of interactive customer experiences with a focal agent/object”, where focal agent/object can be any type of organization and/or its offerings such as branded products or services. As such, customer engagement is seen as a customer’s motivationally driven, volitional cognitive, emotional, and behavioral investments into interactions with such a focal agent/object.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nIn March 2006, the Advertising Research Foundation announced the first definition of customer engagement as \"turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context.\" However, the ARF definition was criticized by some for being too broad. The ARF, World Federation of Advertisers,  Various definitions have translated different aspects of customer engagement. Forrester Consulting's research in 2008, has defined customer engagement as \"creating deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time\". Studies by the Economist Intelligence Unit result in defining customer engagement as, \"an intimate long-term relationship with the customer\". Both of these concepts prescribe that customer engagement is attributed to a rich association formed with customers. With aspects of relationship marketing and service-dominant perspectives, customer engagement can be loosely defined as \"consumers' proactive contributions in co-creating their personalized experiences and perceived value with organizations through active, explicit, and ongoing dialogue and interactions\". The book, Best Digital Marketing Campaigns In The World, defines customer engagement as, \"mutually beneficial relationships with a constantly growing community of online consumers\". The various definitions of customer engagement are diversified by different perspectives and contexts of the engagement process. These are determined by the brand, product, or service, the audience profile, attitudes and behaviours, and messages and channels of communication that are used to interact with the customer.\nSince 2009, a number of new definitions have been proposed in the literature. In 2011, the term was defined as \"the level of a customer’s cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions,\" and identifies the three CE dimensions of immersion (cognitive), passion (emotional) and activation (behavioral). It was also defined as \"a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive, co-creative customer experiences with a particular agent/object (e.g. a brand)\". Researchers have based their work on customer engagement as a multi-dimensional construct, while also identifying that it is context-dependent. Engagement gets manifested in the various interactions that customers undertake, which in turn get shaped up by individual cultures. The context is not limited to geographical context, but also includes the medium with which the user engages. Moreover, customer engagement is the emotional involvement and psychological process in which both new and existing consumers become loyal to specific types of services or products. The degree to which customers pay attention to companies or products, as well as their participation in operations, is referred to as customer engagement.\nAt present, practitioners view and define customer engagement as interaction between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state of the consumer.\n\n\n== Applications in Marketing ==\nMarketing practices aim to create, stimulate or influence customer behaviour, which places conversions into a more strategic context and is premised on the understanding that a focus on maximising conversions can, in some circumstances, decrease the likelihood of repeat conversions. Although customer advocacy has always been a goal for marketers, the rise of online user-generated content has directly influenced levels of advocacy. Customer engagement targets long-term interactions, encouraging customer loyalty and advocacy through word-of-mouth. Although customer engagement marketing is consistent both online and offline, the internet is the basis for marketing efforts.\n\n\n== Ethics ==\nEfforts to boost user engagement at any expense can lead to social media addiction for both service providers and users. Facebook and several other social media platforms have faced criticism for manipulating user emotions to enhance engagement, even if it is knowingly false content. Professor Hany Farid summarized Facebook’s approach, stating, “When you’re in the business of maximizing engagement, you’re not interested in truth.\" Various other techniques used to increase engagement are also considered abusive. For example, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), infinite scrolling, and incentives for users who frequently engage with the service. \n\n\n== Online customer engagement ==\nOffline customer engagement predates online, but the latter is a qualitatively different social phenomenon, unlike any offline customer engagement that social theorists or marketers recognize. In the past, customer engagement has been generated irresolutely through television, radio, media, outdoor advertising, and various other touchpoints ideally during peak and/or high trafficked allocations. However, the only conclusive results of campaigns were sales and/or return on investment figures. The widespread adoption of the internet during the late 1990s has enhanced the processes of customer engagement, in particular, the way in which it can now be measured in different ways on different levels of engagement. It is a recent social phenomenon where people engage online in communities that do not necessarily revolve around a particular product but serve as meeting or networking places. This online engagement has brought about both the empowerment of consumers and the opportunity for businesses to engage with their target customers online. A 2011 market analysis revealed that 80% of online customers, after reading negative online reviews, report making alternate purchasing decisions, while 87% of consumers said a favorable review has confirmed their decision to go through with a purchase.\nThe concept and practice of online customer engagement enables organisations to respond to the fundamental changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as to the increasing ineffectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat', broadcast model of advertising. Due to the fragmentation and specialisation of media and audiences, as well as the proliferation of community and user-generated content, businesses are increasingly losing the power to dictate the communications agenda. Simultaneously, lower switching costs, the geographical widening of the market and the vast choice of content, services and products available online have weakened customer loyalty. Enhancing customers' firm and market-related expertise has been shown to engage customers, strengthen their loyalty, and emotionally connect them more closely to a firm.\nSince the world has reached a population of over 3 billion internet users, it is conclusive that society's interactive culture is significantly influenced by technology. Connectivity is bringing consumers and organizations together, which makes it critical for companies to take advantage and focus on capturing the attention of and interacting with well-informed consumers in order to serve and satisfy them. Connecting with customers establishes exclusivity in their experience, which potentially will increase brand loyalty, and word of mouth, and provides businesses with valuable consumer analytics, insight, and retention. Customer engagement can come in the form of a view, an impression, a reach, a click, a comment, or a share, among many others. These are ways in which analytics and insights into customer engagement can now be measured on different levels, all of which are information that allows businesses to record and process results of customer engagement.\nTaking into consideration the widespread information and connections for consumers, the way to develop penetrable customer engagement is to proactively connect with customers by listening. Listening will empower the consumer, give them control, and endorse a customer-centric two-way dialogue. This dialogue will redefine the role of the consumer as they no longer assume the end user role in the process. Instead of the traditional transaction and/or exchange, the concept becomes a process of partnership between organizations and consumers. Particularly since the internet has provided consumers with the accumulation of much diverse knowledge and understanding, consumers now have increasingly high expectations, stronger sensory perceptions, and hence have become more attracted to experiential values. Therefore, it would only be profitable for businesses to submit to the new criteria, to provide the opportunity for consumers to further immerse in the consumption experience. This experience will involve organizations and consumers sharing and exchanging information, which will generate increased awareness, interest, desire to purchase, retention, and loyalty among consumers, evolving an intimate relationship. Significantly, total openness and strengthening customer service is the selling point here for customers, to make them feel more involved rather than just a number. This will earn trust, engagement, and ultimately word of mouth through endless social circles. Essentially, it is a more dynamic and transparent concept of customer relationship management (CRM).\n\n\n== Customer engagement on social media ==\nThe utilization of social media platforms has emerged as a modern way of improving customer engagement strategies. By curating content that resonates with the interests of customers, businesses cultivate authentic connections and communities online. Platforms such as Instagram and Twitter serve as useful tools for meaning dialog, enabling businesses to make lasting relationships with customers and amplify brand visibility online. \nCustomer engagement on Twitter is a form of social power and is usually measured with likes, replies and retweets.\n\n\n== Marketing value ==\nCustomer engagement marketing is necessitated by a combination of social, technological and market developments. Companies attempt to create an engaging dialogue with target consumers and stimulate their engagement with the given brand. Although this must take place both on and off-line, the internet is considered the primary method. Marketing begins with understanding the internal dynamics of these developments and the behaviour and engagement of consumers online. Consumer-generated media plays a significant role in the understanding and modeling of engagement. The control Web 2.0 consumers have gained is quantified through 'old school' marketing performance metrics.\nThe effectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat' model of advertising is decreasing, which has caused businesses to lose control of communications agendas. In August 2006, McKinsey & Co published a report which indicated that traditional TV advertising would decrease in effectiveness compared to previous decades. As customer audiences have become smaller and more specialised, the fragmentation of media, audiences and the accompanying reduction of audience size have reduced the effectiveness of the traditional top-down, mass, 'interrupt and repeat' advertising model. A Forrester Research's North American Consumer Technology Adoption Study found that people in the 18-26 age group spend more time online than watching TV. Furthermore, the Global Web Index reported that in 2021, YouTube beats any mainstream media platforms when it comes to monthly engagement. This is partly due to the fact that 51% of U.S. and U.K. consumers use YouTube for shopping and product research, a service that traditional media can't really provide.\nIn response to the fragmentation and increased amount of time spent online, marketers have also increased spending in online communication. ContextWeb analysts found marketers who promote on sites like Facebook and New York Times are not as successful at reaching consumers while marketers who promote more on niche websites have a better chance of reaching their audiences. Customer audiences are also broadcasters with the power for circulation and permanence of CGM, businesses lose influence. Rather than trying to position a product using static messages, companies can become the subject of conversation amongst a target market that has already discussed, positioned and rated the product. This also means that consumers can now choose not only when and how but, also, if they will engage with marketing communications. In addition, new media provides consumers with more control over advertising consumption.\nResearch shows the importance of customer engagement in the modern market. The lowering of entry barriers, such as the need for a sales force, access to channels and physical assets, and the geographical widening of the market due to the internet have brought about increasing competition and a decrease in brand loyalty. In combination with lower switching costs, easier access to information about products and suppliers and increased choice, brand loyalty is hard to achieve. The increasing ineffectiveness of television advertising is due to the shift of consumer attention to the internet and new media, which controls advertising consumption and causes a decrease in audience size. A study conducted by Salesforce shows an overwhelming 8% of customers acknowledge that their experience with the business is equivalent to the quality of its products or services. Therefore, it is important to prioritize customer engagement as a business strategy. \nThe proliferation of media that provide consumers with more control over their advertising consumption (subscription-based digital radio and TV) and the simultaneous decrease of trust in advertising and increase of trust in peers point to the need for communications that the customer will desire to engage with. Stimulating a consumer's engagement with a brand is the only way to increase brand loyalty and, therefore, \"the best measure of current and future performance\".\n\n\n== Consumer behavior ==\nCE behaviour became prominent with the advent of the social phenomenon of online CE. Creating and stimulating customer engagement behaviour has recently become an explicit aim of both profit and non-profit organisations in the belief that engaging target customers to a high degree is conducive to furthering business objectives.\nShevlin's definition of CE is well suited to understanding the process that leads to an engaged customer. In its adaptation by Richard Sedley the key word is 'investment'. \"Repeated interactions that strengthen the emotional, psychological or physical investment a customer has in a brand.\"\nA customer's degree of engagement with a company lies in a continuum that represents the strength of his investment in that company. Positive experiences with the company strengthen that investment and move the customer down the line of engagement.\nWhat is important in measuring degrees of involvement is the ability of defining and quantifying the stages on the continuum. One popular suggestion is a four-level model adapted from Kirkpatrick's Levels:\n\nClick – A reader arrived (current metric)\nConsume – A reader read the content\nUnderstood – A reader understood the content and remembers it\nApplied – A reader applies the content in another venue\nConcerns have, however, been expressed as regards the measurability of stages three and four.  Another popular suggestion is Ghuneim's typology of engagement.\n\nThe following consumer typology according to degree of engagement fits also into Ghuneim's continuum: creators (smallest group), critics, collectors, couch potatoes (largest group).\nEngagement is a holistic characterization of a consumer's behavior, encompassing a host of sub-aspects of behaviour such as loyalty, satisfaction, involvement, word-of-mouth advertising, complaining and more.\n\nSatisfaction: Satisfaction is simply the foundation, and the minimum requirement, for a continuing relationship with customers. Engagement extends beyond mere satisfaction.\nLoyalty – Retention: Highly engaged consumers are more loyal. Increasing the engagement of target customers increases the rate of customer retention.\nWord-of-mouth advertising – advocacy: Highly engaged customers are more likely to engage in free (for the company), credible (for their audience) word-of-mouth advertising. This can drive new customer acquisition and can have viral effects.\nAwareness – Effectiveness of communications: When customers are exposed to communication from a company that they are highly engaged with, they tend to actively elaborate on its central idea. This brings about high degrees of central processing and recall.\nFiltering: Consumers filter, categorize and rate the market from head to tail, creating multiple, overlapping folksonomies through tagging, reviewing, rating and recommending.\nComplaint-behaviour: Highly engaged customers are less likely to complain to other current or potential customers, but will address the company directly instead.\nMarketing intelligence: Highly engaged customers can give valuable recommendations for improving the quality of the offering.\nThe behavioural outcomes of an engaged consumer are what links CE to profits. From this point of view,\n\"CE is the best measure of current and future performance; an engaged relationship is probably the only guarantee for a return on your organization's or your clients' objectives.\" Simply attaining a high level of customer satisfaction does not seem to guarantee the customer's business. 60% to 80% of customers who defect to a competitor said they were satisfied or very satisfied on the survey just prior to their defection.\nThe main difference between traditional and customer engagement marketing is marked by these shifts:\n\nFrom 'reach or awareness focused' marketing communications and their metrics (GRP or pageview) towards more targeted and customised interactions that prompt the consumer to engage with and act on the content from the outset.\nFrom absolute distinctions and barriers between an organisation and its target customers towards the participation of consumers in product development, customer service and other aspects of the brand experience.\nFrom one-way, top-down, formal B2C and B2E interaction to continuing, dialogic, decentralised and personalised communications initiated by either party.\nSpecific marketing practices involve:\n\nEncouraging collaborative filtering: Google, Amazon, iTunes, Yahoo LAUNCHcast, Netflix, and Rhapsody encourage their consumers to filter, categorise and rate; that is, to market their products. They realise consumers are not only much more adept at creating highly targeted taxonomies (folksonomies) given that they are more adept at delineating the segment they themselves constitute, but, also, that they are willing to do so for free. And to the extent they cannot, they do it for them. If enough people like the band Groove Armada as well as the band The Crystal Method, there may well be a stylistic connection between them, despite the fact that one's categorised as 'downtempo' and the other 'beats and breaks'. Such strong associations tell Yahoo! to put the two on the same playlist more often, and if the positive ratings continue to come in, that connection is reinforced. Amazon does the same with their ‘customers who bought this item also bought…’ recommendations.\nCommunity development: Helping target customers develop their own communities or create new ones.\nCommunity participation: (See Communal marketing) Consumers do not filter and rate companies and their offerings within company websites only. Being able, with little effort, cost or technical skills, to create their own online localities, a large percentage of the filtering and rating takes place in non-sponsored, online spaces. Organisations must go and meet their target customers at their favoured online hangouts to not only listen but also participate in the dialogue.\nHelp consumers engage with one another: Give them content (viral podcasting, videocasting, games, v-cards etc.) they can use to engage with one another.\nSolicitation of user generated content: Engage them directly or indirectly with your product by giving them the means or incentive to create user generated content.\nCustomer self-service: Help them create a customer service FAQ in wiki or blog format. Create a blog where technical support staff and customers can communicate directly.\nProduct co-development: Create a blog where product developers and consumers can communicate directly.\nLeading by teaching: Help customers in product selection by first teaching them practically, showing them a video about product use and then help them to select the product.\n\n\n== Metrics ==\nAll marketing practices, including internet marketing, include measuring the effectiveness of various media along the customer engagement cycle, as consumers travel from awareness to purchase. Often the use of CVP Analysis factors into strategy decisions, including budgets and media placement.\nThe CE metric is useful for:\na) Planning:\n\nIdentify where CE-marketing efforts should take place; which of the communities that the target customers participate in are the most engaging?\nSpecify the way in which target customers engage, or want to engage, with the company or offering.\nb) Measuring Effectiveness: Measure how successful CE-marketing efforts have been at engaging target customers.\nThe importance of CE as a marketing metric is reflected in ARF's statement:\n\"The industry is moving toward customer engagement with marketing communications as the 21st century metric of marketing efficiency and effectiveness.\"\nARF envisages CE exclusively as a metric of engagement with communication, but it is not necessary to distinguish between engaging with the communication and with the product since CE behaviour deals with, and is influenced by, involvement with both.\nIn order to be operational, CE-metrics must be combined with psychodemographics. It is not enough to know that a website has 500 highly engaged members, for instance; it is imperative to know what percentage are members of the company's target market. As a metric for effectiveness, Scott Karp suggests, CE is the solution to the same intractable problems that have long been a struggle for old media: how to prove value.\nThe CE-metric is synthetic and integrates a number of variables. The World Federation of Advertisers calls it 'consumer-centric holistic measurement'. The following items have all been proposed as components of a CE-metric:\nRoot metrics\n\nDuration of visit\nFrequency of visit (returning to the site directly – through a URL or bookmark – or indirectly).\n% repeat visits\nRecency of visit\nDepth of visit (% of site visited)\nClick-through rate\nSales\nLifetime value\nAction metrics\n\nRSS feed subscriptions\nBookmarks, tags, ratings\nViewing of high-value or medium-value content (as valued from the organisation's point-of-view). 'Depth' of visit can be combined with this variable.\nInquiries\nProviding personal information\nDownloads\nContent resyndication\nCustomer reviews\nComments: their quality is another indicator of the degree of engagement.\nRatio between posts and comments plus trackbacks.\nIn selecting the components of a CE-metric, the following issues must be resolved:\n\nFlexible metric vs. Industry standard: According to some, CE \"measurement has never been one size fits-all\" but should vary according to industry, organisation, business goal etc. On the other hand, corporate clients and even agencies also desire some type of solid index. Internal metrics could, perhaps, be developed in addition to a comparative, industry-wide one.\nRelative weighting: The relative weighting associated with each CE-component in an algorithm. For instance, is subscribing to RSS more important than contributing a comment? If yes how much more important exactly? Relative weighting links up with the issue of flexible vs. standardised metrics: Is the relative weighting going to be solid – as will be required if the CE-metric is to be standardised – or is it going to differ depending on the industry, organisation, business goals etc.?\nComponent measurability: Most of the components of a CE-metric face problems of measurement. Duration of visit for example suffers from (a) failing to capture the most engaged users who like to peruse RSS feeds; (b) inaccuracy arising from leaving a tab open during breaks, stopping to converse with co-workers, etc.\nLength of measurement: For how long must the various CE components be measured if CE is to reflect loyalty rather than short-term, faddish engagement?\n\n\n== See also ==\nActive users\nMarketing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCheung, Christy M.K.; Shen, Xiao-Liang; Lee, Zach W.Y.; Chan, Tommy K.H.

        "content": "Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategic process that organizations use to manage, analyze, and improve their interactions with customers. By using data-driven insights, CRM helps businesses optimize communication, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.\nCRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone (which many services come with a softphone), email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media. They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to better cater to their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth. CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviours, from the perspective of the company.\nThe global customer relationship management market size is projected to grow from $101.41 billion in 2024 to $262.74 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.6% \n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking. At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. One of the best-known precursors of modern-day CRM is the Farley File. Developed by Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager, James Farley, the Farley File was a comprehensive set of records detailing political and personal facts about people FDR and Farley met or were supposed to meet. Using it, people that FDR met were impressed by his \"recall\" of facts about their family and what they were doing professionally and politically. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestenbaum introduced the concept of database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data. By 1987, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney had released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of a digital Rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.\nThe trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize lead potential, including Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, who designed the first CRM product, Siebel Customer Relationship Management, in 1993. In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions, established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, Zoho Corporation, SAP, Peoplesoft (an Oracle subsidiary as of 2005) and Navision started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.\nCustomer relationship management was popularized in 1997 due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities. Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted customer base was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle), Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.\nThe first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to the cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction. Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favourite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell. The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions. In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business. In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it \"identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors\".\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Strategic ===\nStrategic CRM concentrates upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.\nThe focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV.\n\n\n=== Operational ===\nThe primary goal of CRM systems is integration and automation of sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of three main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.\n\nSales force automation works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client. It implements sales promotion analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.\nMarketing automation focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on customer engagement through social media.\nService automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.\n\n\n=== Analytical ===\nThe role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions. Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently. For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After reviewing their data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.\n\n\n=== Collaborative ===\nThe third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organizations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.\n\n\n=== Customer data platform ===\n\nA customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.  As of February 2017, about twenty companies were selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\nThe main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of the value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of their marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgment of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. By studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.\nRelational Intelligence, which is the awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm and the ability of the firm to reinforce or change those connections, is an important component of the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm's industrial view of customer relationships. A lack of relational intelligence is a sign that firms still see customers as resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than people looking for interesting and personalized interactions.\nCRM systems include:\n\nData warehouse technology, which is used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.\nOpportunity management, which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.\nCRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.\nSome CRM software is available as a software as a service (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.\nFor small businesses, a CRM system may consist of a contact management system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).\nCRM systems for eCommerce focus on marketing automation tasks such as cart rescue, re-engaging users with email, and personalization.\nCustomer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.\nSystems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.\nCRM not only indicates technology and strategy but also indicates an integrated approach that includes employees knowledge and organizational culture to embrace the CRM philosophy.\n\n\n== Effect on customer satisfaction ==\nCustomer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection. The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to affect customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.\nFirstly, firms can customize their offerings for each customer. By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers. This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because the perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts. For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction. CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.\n\n\n=== Customer benefits ===\nWith CRM systems, customers are served on the day-to-day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self-service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, then the customer satisfaction level is expected to increase. These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity, which are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.\n\nEnhanced ability to target profitable customers.\nIntegrated assistance across channels.\nEnhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness.\nImproved pricing.\nCustomized products and services.\nImproved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.\nIndividualized marketing messages are also called campaigns.\nConnect customers and all channels on a single platform.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\nResearch has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance. Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above the industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.\nAmazon has also seen successes through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.\n\n\n== Customer profile ==\n\nA customer profile is a detailed description of any particular classification of customer which is created to represent the typical users of a product or service. Customer profiling is a method to understand your customers in terms of demographics, behaviour and lifestyle. It is used to help make customer-focused decisions without confusing the scope of the project with personal opinion. Overall profiling is gathering information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.\nCustomer or consumer profiles are the essences of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. \nThe three basic methods of customer profiling are the psychographic approach, the consumer typology approach, and the consumer characteristics approach. These customer profiling methods help you design your business around who your customers are and help you make better customer-centered decisions.\n\n\n== Improving CRM ==\nConsultants hold that it is important for companies to establish strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence. According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars, and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate, or anything in between.\n\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nManagers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. \nCompanies must also improve the relational intelligence of their CRM systems. Companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more. Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence. Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customers' signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.\n\n\n=== Employee training ===\nMany firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and create strong customer-brand relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be trained to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.\n\n\n== In practice ==\n\n\n=== Call centers ===\nContact centre CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between the company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.\nGrowing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.\nGamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.\n\n\n=== Contact-center automation ===\nContact-center automation,  CCA, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question. Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.\n\n\n=== Social media ===\nSocial CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers. Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand. With the increase in the use of social media platforms, integrating CRM with the help of social media can potentially be a quicker and more cost-friendly process.\nSome CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.\nEnterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.\n\n\n=== Location-based services ===\nCRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.\n\n\n=== Business-to-business transactions ===\nDespite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.\nThe main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.\n\n\n== Market trends ==\n\n\n=== Social networking ===\nIn the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like \"system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites\" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.\nThe era of the \"social customer\" refers to the use of social media by customers.\n\n\n=== Mobile ===\nSome CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.\n\n\n=== Cloud computing and SaaS ===\nMany CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position. Over the years, the number of SaaS providers has grown with CRM being the leading category for 2024.\nTraditional providers moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011, and Taleo and Eloqua in 2012; SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011 and NetSuite acquired Verenia in 2022.\n\n\n=== Sales and sales force automation ===\nSales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM software. Some of the top CRM trends identified in 2021 include focusing on customer service automation such as chatbots, hyper-personalization based on customer data and insights, and the use of unified CRM systems. CRM vendors support sales productivity with different products, such as tools that measure the effectiveness of ads that appear in 3D video games.\nPharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.\n\n\n=== Vendor relationship management ===\nAnother related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of CRM Magazine.\n\n\n=== Customer success ===\nAnother trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for a more holistic understanding of customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space. As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites.\n\n\n=== AI and predictive analytics ===\nIn 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCompanies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably. They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients may be treated like an exchange party, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan. In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent. Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis. In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems. However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among developing countries' consumers.\nCollection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacy laws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.\nPart of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company. The CRM paradox, also referred to as the \"dark side of CRM\", may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers. This can happen because a business prioritizes customers who are more profitable, more relationship-orientated or tend to have increased loyalty to the company. Although focusing on such customers by itself is not a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.\nCRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communication with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n Business portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In sales, commerce, and economics, a customer (sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser) is the recipient of a good, service, product, or an idea, obtained from a seller, vendor, or supplier via a financial transaction or an exchange for money or some other valuable consideration.\n\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nEarly societies relied on a gift economy based on favours. Later, as commerce developed, less permanent human relations were formed, depending more on transitory needs rather than enduring social desires. Customers are generally said to be the purchasers of goods and services, while clients are those who receive personalized advice and solutions. Although such distinctions have no contemporary semantic weight, agencies such as law firms, film studios, and health care providers tend to prefer client, while grocery stores, banks, and restaurants tend to prefer customer instead.\n\n\n=== Client ===\n\nThe term client is derived from Latin clients or care meaning \"to incline\" or \"to bend\", and is related to the emotive idea of closure. It is widely believed that people only change their habits when motivated by greed and fear. Winning a client is therefore a singular event, which is why professional specialists who deal with particular problems tend to attract long-term clients rather than regular customers. Unlike regular customers, who buy merely on price and value, long-term clients buy on experience and trust.\n\n\n=== Customer ===\nClients who habitually return to a seller develop customs that allow for regular, sustained commerce that allows the seller to develop statistical models to optimize production processes (which change the nature or form of goods or services) and supply chains (which change the location or formalize the changes of ownership or entitlement transactions). \nAn \"end customer\" denotes the person at the end of a supply chain who ultimately purchases or utilised the goods or services. ISO principles for quality management note the importance of recognising both direct and indirect customers.\n\n\n=== Employer ===\nA client paying for construction work is often referred to as an \"employer\".\n\n\n== Customer segmentation ==\n\nIn the 21st century, customers are generally categorized into two types:\n\nan entrepreneur or trader (sometimes a commercial Intermediary) - a dealer who purchases goods for re-sale.\nan end user or ultimate customer who does not re-sell the things bought but is the actual consumer or an agent such as a Purchasing officer for the consumer.\nA customer may or may not also be a consumer, but the two notions are distinct.  A customer purchases goods; a consumer uses them.  An ultimate customer may be a consumer as well, but just as equally may have purchased items for someone else to consume.  An intermediate customer is not a consumer at all.  The situation is somewhat complicated in that ultimate customers of so-called industrial goods and services (who are entities such as government bodies, manufacturers, and educational and medical institutions) either themselves use up the goods and services that they buy, or incorporate them into other finished products, and so are technically consumers, too.  However, they are rarely called that, but are rather called industrial customers or business-to-business customers.  Similarly, customers who buy services rather than goods are rarely called consumers.\nSix Sigma doctrine places (active) customers in opposition to two other classes of people: not-customers and non-customers:\n\nCustomers of a given business have actively dealt with that business within a particular recent period that depends on the product sold.\nNot-customers are either past customers who are no longer customers or potential customers who choose to interact with the competition.\nNon-customers are people who are active in a different market segment entirely.\nGeoff Tennant, a Six Sigma consultant from the United Kingdom, uses the following analogy to explain the difference:  A supermarket's customer is the person buying milk at that supermarket; a not-customer buys milk from a competing supermarket, whereas a non-customer does not buy milk from supermarkets at all but rather \"has milk delivered to the door in the traditional British way\".\nTennant also categorizes customers in another way that is employed outside the fields of marketing.  While marketers, market regulation, and economists use the intermediate/ultimate categorization, the field of customer service more often categorizes customers into two classes:\n\nAn external customer of an organization is a customer who is not directly connected to that organization.\nAn internal customer is a customer who is directly connected to an organization, and is usually (but not necessarily) internal to the organization.  Internal customers are usually stakeholders, employees, or shareholders, but the definition also encompasses creditors and external regulators.\nBefore the introduction of the notion of an internal customer, external customers were, simply, customers. Quality-management writer Joseph M. Juran popularized the concept, introducing it in 1988 in the fourth edition of his Quality Control Handbook (Juran 1988).  The idea has since gained wide acceptance in the literature on total quality management and service marketing; and many organizations as of 2016 recognize the customer satisfaction of internal customers as a precursor to, and a prerequisite for, external customer satisfaction, with authors such as Tansuhaj, Randall & McCullough 1991 regarding service organizations which design products for internal customer satisfaction as better able to satisfy the needs of external customers. Research on the theory and practice of managing the internal customer continues as of 2016 in a variety of service-sector industries.\n\n\n=== Arguments against use of the term \"internal customers\" ===\nLeading authors in management and marketing, like Peter Drucker, Philip Kotler, W. Edwards Deming, etc., have not used the term \"internal customer\" in their works. They consider the \"customer\" as a very specific role in society which represents a crucial part in the relationship between the demand and the supply. Some of the most important characteristics of any customer are that: any customer is never in a subordination line with any supplier; any customer has equal positions with the supplier within negotiations, and any customer can accept or reject any offer for a service or a product. Peter Drucker wrote, \"They are all people who can say no, people who have the choice to accept or reject what you offer.\"\nIn opposition to the stated customer's characteristics, relationships between colleagues in a company are always based on subordination – direct or indirect. Company employees are obliged to follow the processes of their companies. Company employees do not have the authority to choose a unit/colleague to fulfill any task. Company employees are obliged to use an existing unit/colleague by using the company's structure and approved processes, therefore these internal relationships are not considered as an option.\nMany authors in ITIL and Six Sigma methodologies define \"internal customer\" as an internal part of a company that uses the output of another part of a company as its input. But actually, this definition describes better a classical internal process rather than a relationship between a customer and a supplier. Peter Drucker considers that there are no customers inside organizations. He wrote \"Inside an organization, there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced.\" In addition, William Deming advises managers, in his 9th point, to \"Break down barriers between departments. They must work as a team\", which means that there have to be teamwork in a company rather than a supplier/customer relationship. One more argument, even the ITIL methodology admits that \"the term 'colleague' may be more accurate in describing how two internal groups are related to one another.\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nClient (business)\nCustomer advocacy\nCustomer centricity\nCustomer data integration\nCustomer delight\nCustomer relationship management\nEarly adopter\nGuided selling\nProcurement\nService level agreement\nThe customer is always right\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== References ===\nBlythe, Jim (2008).

        "content": "Customer success is a business methodology and organizational function focused on ensuring customers achieve their desired outcomes while using a company's products or services. The discipline emerged in the early 2000s alongside the growth of software as a service (SaaS) and subscription-based business models, where ongoing customer satisfaction directly impacts recurring revenue.\nUnlike traditional customer service, which typically responds to customer issues reactively, customer success takes a proactive approach to ensure customers realize value from their investments. The methodology encompasses strategic planning, relationship management, and data-driven interventions designed to reduce customer churn, increase customer lifetime value, and drive expansion revenue.\nCustomer success has evolved from a support function to a strategic business discipline, with dedicated teams, specialized technology platforms, and established career paths. Research indicates that companies with mature customer success programs achieve 12% higher revenue growth and 19% higher gross margins compared to those without formal customer success initiatives.\n\n\n== Definition and core principles ==\nCustomer success is defined as the business methodology that ensures customers achieve their desired outcomes while using a company's products or services. The approach is built on several core principles:\nProactive engagement: Customer success teams identify potential issues and opportunities before they impact the customer relationship. This contrasts with reactive customer service models that address problems after they occur.\nOutcome-focused approach: Rather than focusing solely on product usage, customer success emphasizes helping customers achieve their business objectives. This alignment creates stronger customer relationships and increases the likelihood of contract renewals and expansions.\nData-driven decision making: Customer success relies heavily on customer data, usage analytics, and health scoring to identify at-risk accounts and expansion opportunities. This quantitative approach enables scalable customer management across large customer bases.\n\n\n== History and evolution ==\n\n\n=== Origins in software industry ===\nThe customer success discipline emerged in the early 2000s as software as a service (SaaS) companies recognized fundamental differences between traditional software sales and subscription-based models. In traditional enterprise software, customers paid large upfront license fees regardless of actual usage or satisfaction. The SaaS model's recurring revenue structure created a direct correlation between customer satisfaction and business success.\nEarly pioneers including Salesforce, Workday, and ServiceNow developed customer success functions to address the unique challenges of subscription businesses. These companies recognized that acquiring customers was only the first step; ensuring ongoing value realization became critical for sustainable growth.\n\n\n=== Expansion beyond SaaS ===\nBy 2010, customer success methodologies began expanding beyond technology companies. Traditional industries including financial services, healthcare, and manufacturing adopted customer success principles to improve customer retention and drive growth in competitive markets.\nThe 2020s saw further evolution with the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, enabling more sophisticated customer health monitoring and predictive analytics. Companies began using these tools to identify expansion opportunities and prevent churn at scale.\n\n\n== Customer success frameworks ==\n\n\n=== Engagement models ===\nCustomer success organizations typically employ three primary engagement models based on customer value and complexity:\nHigh-touch model: Assigned customer success managers provide personalized, one-to-one support for high-value enterprise clients. This model involves regular strategic business reviews, executive relationship management, and custom success planning.\nLow-touch model: Automated and digital-first approaches serve smaller customers through self-service resources, automated communications, and scalable programs. This model relies heavily on product-led growth strategies and in-app guidance.\nHybrid model: Combines elements of both high-touch and low-touch approaches, typically segmenting customers by value, complexity, or strategic importance. This model optimizes resource allocation while maintaining appropriate service levels across customer segments.\n\n\n=== Customer journey mapping ===\nSuccessful customer success programs map distinct phases of the customer lifecycle:\nOnboarding: Initial product setup, training, and early value realization. Research shows that customers who achieve early success are 5x more likely to become long-term advocates.\nAdoption: Expanding product usage and feature adoption across the customer organization. This phase focuses on driving deeper engagement and demonstrating continued value.\nExpansion: Identifying opportunities for account growth through additional products, services, or user licenses. Customer success teams typically own or significantly influence expansion revenue targets.\nAdvocacy: Converting satisfied customers into references, case studies, and referral sources. Customer advocates provide social proof and reduce customer acquisition costs.\n\n\n== Roles and organizational structure ==\n\n\n=== Customer success manager ===\nThe customer success manager (CSM) serves as the primary customer advocate within the vendor organization. CSMs are responsible for understanding customer business objectives, monitoring product usage and satisfaction, and coordinating internal resources to ensure customer success.\nKey responsibilities include:\n\nDeveloping customer success plans aligned with business objectives\nConducting regular business reviews and strategic planning sessions\nIdentifying and mitigating risks that could lead to customer churn\nRecognizing expansion opportunities and coordinating with sales teams\nServing as the voice of the customer within the organization\n\n\n=== Customer success leadership ===\nCustomer success leadership roles have evolved to include strategic positions such as Chief Customer Officer (CCO), Vice President of Customer Success, and Director of Customer Experience. These roles are responsible for developing customer success strategy, managing organizational resources, and demonstrating measurable business impact.\nCustomer success leaders typically report to executive leadership and are accountable for metrics including customer retention rates, expansion revenue, and customer lifetime value. The role requires cross-functional collaboration with sales, marketing, product development, and support teams.\n\n\n== Metrics and measurement ==\n\n\n=== Key performance indicators ===\nCustomer success organizations rely on several key metrics to measure effectiveness and business impact:\nCustomer health score: Composite metric combining product usage, support ticket volume, payment history, and engagement levels. Health scores enable proactive intervention for at-risk accounts.\nNet Promoter Score (NPS): Measures customer loyalty and likelihood to recommend the product or service. NPS serves as a leading indicator of customer satisfaction and potential churn.\nCustomer Satisfaction Score (CSAT): Measures short-term customer satisfaction with specific interactions or experiences. CSAT provides immediate feedback on customer success program effectiveness.\nGross Revenue Retention (GRR): Measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, excluding expansion revenue. GRR indicates the effectiveness of churn prevention efforts.\nNet Revenue Retention (NRR): Measures the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, including expansion revenue. NRR above 100% indicates net customer growth.\nTime to Value (TTV): is a key customer success metric, measuring the interval from onboarding to the first realization of value by the customer. Faster TTV correlates with improved client satisfaction and retention\n\n\n== Technology and tools ==\n\n\n=== Customer success platforms ===\nSpecialized customer success platforms have emerged to support scalable customer management. These platforms integrate customer data from multiple sources to provide comprehensive customer views and enable automated interventions.\nLeading platforms include capabilities for:\n\nCustomer health monitoring and predictive analytics\nAutomated customer communication and outreach\nSuccess plan development and tracking\nIntegration with customer relationship management and support systems\nReporting and analytics for customer success metrics\n\n\n=== Data integration and analytics ===\nModern customer success relies heavily on data integration across customer touchpoints. Organizations combine product usage data, support interactions, financial information, and external data sources to create comprehensive customer profiles.\nMachine learning and artificial intelligence technologies enable predictive customer success, identifying at-risk accounts and expansion opportunities before they become apparent through traditional metrics.\n\n\n== Industry impact ==\n\n\n=== Business outcomes ===\nCompanies with mature customer success programs demonstrate superior financial performance across multiple metrics. Research indicates that organizations with dedicated customer success teams achieve:\n\n12% higher revenue growth rates\n19% higher gross margins\n15% higher customer retention rates\n25% higher customer lifetime value\n\n\n=== Market evolution ===\nThe customer success industry has experienced significant growth, with the global customer success software market projected to reach $1.2 billion by 2025. This growth reflects increasing recognition of customer success as a strategic business discipline rather than a support function.\nProfessional organizations such as the Customer Success Association and Customer Success Network have emerged to support practitioners with training, certification, and best practice sharing. These organizations have established customer success as a recognized professional discipline with defined career paths and competency frameworks.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer relationship management\nCustomer service\nSoftware as a service\nCustomer experience\nChurn rate\nCustomer lifetime value\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCustomer Success Association\nCustomer Success Network",

        "content": "Customer satisfaction is a term frequently used in marketing to evaluate customer experience. It is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. Customer satisfaction is defined as \"the number of customers, or percentage of total customers, whose reported experience with a firm, its products, or its services (ratings) exceeds specified satisfaction goals\". Enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering customer loyalty are pivotal for businesses, given the significant importance of improving the balance between customer attitudes before and after the consumption process.\nExpectancy disconfirmation theory is the most widely accepted theoretical framework for explaining customer satisfaction. However, other frameworks, such as equity theory, attribution theory, contrast theory, assimilation theory, and various others, are also used to gain insights into customer satisfaction. However, traditionally applied satisfaction surveys are influence by biases related to social desirability, availability heuristics, memory limitations, respondents' mood while answering questions, as well as affective, unconscious, and dynamic nature of customer experience. \nThe Marketing Accountability Standards Board endorses the definitions, purposes, and measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 71 percent responded that they found a customer satisfaction metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses. Customer satisfaction is viewed as a key performance indicator within business and is often part of a balanced scorecard. In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a major differentiator and increasingly has become an important element of business strategy.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nCustomer satisfaction operates in relation to both consumer and business usage of goods and services. Farris et al. wrote that \"[c]ustomer satisfaction provides a leading indicator of consumer purchase intentions and loyalty\".\nThe authors also wrote that \"customer satisfaction data are among the most frequently collected indicators of market perceptions. Their principal use is twofold:\" \n\n\"Within organizations, the collection, analysis and dissemination of these data send a message about the importance of tending to customers and ensuring that they have a positive experience with the company's goods and services.\"\n\"Although sales or market share can indicate how well a firm is performing currently, satisfaction is perhaps the best indicator of how likely it is that the firm’s customers will make further purchases in the future. Much research has focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and retention. Studies indicate that the ramifications of satisfaction are most strongly realized at the extremes.\"\nOn a five-point scale, \"individuals who rate their satisfaction level as '5' are likely to become return customers and might even evangelize for the firm. A second important metric related to satisfaction is willingness to recommend. This metric is defined as \"[t]he percentage of surveyed customers who indicate that they would recommend a brand to friends\". A previous study about customer satisfaction stated that when a customer is satisfied with a product, he or she might recommend it to friends, relatives and colleagues. This can be a powerful marketing advantage. According to Farris et al., \"[i]ndividuals who rate their satisfaction level as '1,' by contrast, are unlikely to return. Further, they can hurt the firm by making negative comments about it to prospective customers. Willingness to recommend is a key metric relating to customer satisfaction.\"\nIn a business context where purchasing decisions involve a number of different individuals with varying objectives and professional backgrounds, Jagdish Sheth noted that varying degrees of satisfaction with previous usage of a product or a supplier are one of the reasons why business decisions can become challenging when a consensus on a purchasing decision is required.\n\n\n== Theoretical ground ==\nIn the research literature, the antecedents of customer satisfaction are studied from different perspectives. These perspectives extend from the psychological to the physical as well as from the normative perspective. However, in much of the literature, research has been focused on two basic constructs, (a) expectations prior to purchase or use of a product and (b) customer perception of the performance of that product after using it.\nA customer's expectations about a product bear on how the customer thinks the product will perform. Consumers are thought to have various \"types\" of expectations when forming opinions about a product's anticipated performance. Miller (1977) described four types of expectations: ideal, expected, minimum tolerable, and desirable. Day (1977) underlined different types of expectations, including ones about costs, the nature of the product, benefits, and social value. \nIt is considered that customers judge products on a limited set of norms and attributes. Olshavsky and Miller (1972) and Olson and Dover (1976) designed their researches as to manipulate actual product performance, and their aim was to find out how perceived performance ratings were influenced by expectations. These studies took out the discussions about explaining the differences between expectations and perceived performance.\"\nIn some research studies, scholars have been able to establish that customer satisfaction has a strong emotional, i.e., affective, component. Still others show that the cognitive and affective components of customer satisfaction reciprocally influence each other over time to determine overall satisfaction.\nEspecially for durable goods that are consumed over time, there is value to taking a dynamic perspective on customer satisfaction. Within a dynamic perspective, customer satisfaction can evolve over time as customers repeatedly use a product or interact with a service. The satisfaction experienced with each interaction (transactional satisfaction) can influence the overall, cumulative satisfaction. Scholars showed that it is not just overall customer satisfaction, but also customer loyalty that evolves over time.\n\n\n=== The disconfirmation model ===\n\"The Disconfirmation Model is based on the comparison of customers’ [expectations] and their [perceived performance] ratings. Specifically, an individual’s expectations are confirmed when a product performs as expected. It is negatively confirmed when a product performs more poorly than expected. The disconfirmation is positive when a product performs over the expectations (Churchill & Suprenant 1982).\nThere are four constructs to describe the traditional disconfirmation paradigm mentioned as expectations, performance, disconfirmation and satisfaction.\"\n\"Satisfaction is considered as an outcome of purchase and use, resulting from the buyers’ comparison of expected rewards and incurred costs of the purchase in relation to the anticipated consequences. In operation, satisfaction is somehow similar to attitude as it can be evaluated as the sum of satisfactions with some features of a product.\"\n\"In the literature, cognitive and affective models of satisfaction are also developed and considered as alternatives (Pfaff, 1977).\nChurchill and Suprenant in 1982, evaluated various studies in the literature and formed an overview of Disconfirmation process in the following figure:\" \n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nOrganizations need to retain existing customers while targeting non-customers. Measuring customer satisfaction provides an indication of how successful the organization is at providing products or services to the marketplace.\n\"Customer satisfaction is measured at the individual level, but it is almost always reported at an aggregate level. It can be, and often is, measured along various dimensions. A hotel, for example, might ask customers to rate their experience with its front desk and check-in service, with the room, with the amenities in the room, with the restaurants, and so on. Additionally, in a holistic sense, the hotel might ask about overall satisfaction 'with your stay.'\"\nAs research on consumption experiences grows, evidence suggests that consumers purchase goods and services for a combination of two types of benefits: hedonic and utilitarian. Hedonic benefits are associated with the sensory and experiential attributes of the product. Utilitarian benefits of a product are associated with the more instrumental and functional attributes of the product (Batra and Athola 1990).\nCustomer satisfaction is an ambiguous and abstract concept and the actual manifestation of the state of satisfaction will vary from person to person and product/service to product/service. The state of satisfaction depends on a number of both psychological and physical variables which correlate with satisfaction behaviors such as return and recommend rate. The level of satisfaction can also vary depending on other options the customer may have and other products against which the customer can compare the organization's products.\nWork done by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry (Leonard L) between 1985 and 1988 provides the basis for the measurement of customer satisfaction with a service by using the gap between the customer's expectation of performance and their perceived experience of performance. This provides the measurer with a satisfaction \"gap\" which is objective and quantitative in nature. Work done by Cronin and Taylor propose the \"confirmation/disconfirmation\" theory of combining the \"gap\" described by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry as two different measures (perception and expectation of performance) into a single measurement of performance according to expectation.\nThe usual measures of customer satisfaction involve a survey using a Likert scale. The customer is asked to evaluate each statement in terms of their perceptions and expectations of performance of the organization being measured.\nGood quality measures need to have high satisfaction loading, good reliability, and low error variances. In an empirical study comparing commonly used satisfaction measures it was found that two multi-item semantic differential scales performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian service consumption contexts. A study by Wirtz & Lee (2003), found that a six-item 7-point semantic differential scale (for example, Oliver and Swan 1983), which is a six-item 7-point bipolar scale, consistently performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian services. It loaded most highly on satisfaction, had the highest item reliability, and had by far the lowest error variance across both studies. In the study, the six items asked respondents’ evaluation of their most recent experience with ATM services and ice cream restaurant, along seven points within these six items: “pleased me to displeased me”, “contented with to disgusted with”, “very satisfied with to very dissatisfied with”, “did a good job for me to did a poor job for me”, “wise choice to poor choice” and “happy with to unhappy with”. A semantic differential (4 items) scale (e.g., Eroglu and Machleit 1990), which is a four-item 7-point bipolar scale, was the second best performing measure, which was again consistent across both contexts. In the study, respondents were asked to evaluate their experience with both products, along seven points within these four items: “satisfied to dissatisfied”, “favorable to unfavorable”, “pleasant to unpleasant” and “I like it very much to I didn’t like it at all”. The third best scale was single-item percentage measure, a one-item 7-point bipolar scale (e.g., Westbrook 1980). Again, the respondents were asked to evaluate their experience on both ATM services and ice cream restaurants, along seven points within “delighted to terrible”.\nFinally, all measures captured both affective and cognitive aspects of satisfaction, independent of their scale anchors. Affective measures capture a consumer’s attitude (liking/disliking) towards a product, which can result from any product information or experience. On the other hand, cognitive element is defined as an appraisal or conclusion on how the product’s performance compared against expectations (or exceeded or fell short of expectations), was useful (or not useful), fit the situation (or did not fit), exceeded the requirements of the situation (or did not exceed).\n\nRecent research shows that in most commercial applications, such as firms conducting customer surveys, a single-item overall satisfaction scale performs just as well as a multi-item scale. Especially in larger scale studies where a researcher needs to gather data from a large number of customers, a single-item scale may be preferred because it can reduce total survey error.  An interesting recent finding from re-interviewing the same clients of a firm is that only 50% of respondents give the same satisfaction rating when re-interviewed, even when there has been no service encounter between the client and firm between surveys.  The study found a 'regression to the mean' effect in customer satisfaction responses, whereby the respondent group who gave unduly low scores in the first survey regressed up toward the mean level in the second, while the group who gave unduly high scores tended to regress downward toward the overall mean level in the second survey.\n\n\n== Methodologies ==\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is a scientific standard of customer satisfaction. Academic research has shown that the national ACSI score is a strong predictor of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and an even stronger predictor of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth. On the microeconomic level, academic studies have shown that ACSI data is related to a firm's financial performance in terms of return on investment (ROI), sales, long-term firm value (Tobin's q), cash flow, cash flow volatility, human capital performance, portfolio returns, debt financing, risk, and consumer spending. Increasing ACSI scores have been shown to predict loyalty, word-of-mouth recommendations, and purchase behavior. The ACSI measures customer satisfaction annually for more than 200 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors. In addition to quarterly reports, the ACSI methodology can be applied to private sector companies and government agencies in order to improve loyalty and purchase intent.\nThe Kano model is a theory of product development and customer satisfaction developed in the 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano that classifies customer preferences into five categories: Attractive, One-Dimensional, Must-Be, Indifferent, Reverse. The Kano model offers some insight into the product attributes which are perceived to be important to customers.\nSERVQUAL or RATER is a service-quality framework that has been incorporated into customer-satisfaction surveys (e.g., the revised Norwegian Customer Satisfaction Barometer) to indicate the gap between customer expectations and experience.\nJ.D. Power and Associates provides another measure of customer satisfaction, known for its top-box approach and automotive industry rankings. J.D. Power and Associates' marketing research consists primarily of consumer surveys and is publicly known for the value of its product awards.\nOther research and consulting firms have customer satisfaction solutions as well. These include A.T. Kearney's Customer Satisfaction Audit process, which incorporates the Stages of Excellence framework and which helps define a company’s status against eight critically identified dimensions.\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is also used to measure customer satisfaction. On a scale of 0 to 10, this score measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company to others. Despite many points of criticism from a scientific point of view, the NPS is widely used in practice. Its popularity and broad use have been attributed to its simplicity and its openly available methodology.\nFor B2B customer satisfaction surveys, where there is a small customer base, a high response rate to the survey is desirable. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (2012) found that response rates for paper-based surveys were around 10% and the response rates for e-surveys (web, wap and e-mail) were averaging between 5% and 15% - which can only provide a straw poll of the customers' opinions.\nIn the European Union member states, many methods for measuring impact and satisfaction of e-government services are in use, which the eGovMoNet project sought to compare and harmonize.\nThese customer satisfaction methodologies have not been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board according to MMAP (marketing metric audit protocol).\nThere are many operational strategies for improving customer satisfaction but at the most fundamental level you need to understand customer expectations.\nRecently there has been a growing interest in predicting customer satisfaction using big data and machine learning methods (with behavioral and demographic features as predictors) to take targeted preventive actions aimed at avoiding churn, complaints and dissatisfaction.\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\nA 2008 survey found that only 3.5% of Chinese consumers were satisfied with their online shopping experience. A 2020 Arizona State University survey found that customer satisfaction in the United States is deteriorating. Roughly two-thirds of survey participants reported feeling \"rage\" over their experiences as consumers. A multi-decade decline in consumer satisfaction since the 1970s was observed. A majority of respondents felt that their customer service complaints were not sufficiently addressed by businesses. A 2022 report found that consumer experiences in the United States had declined substantially in the 2 years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United Kingdom in 2022, customer service complaints were at record highs, owing to staffing shortages and the supply crisis related to the COVID pandemic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer experience\nBusiness case\nComputer user satisfaction\nCustomer satisfaction research\nCustomer service\nCustomer Loyalty\nThe International Customer Service Institute\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCustomer Satisfaction: A Central Phenomenon in Marketing",

        "content": "In sales, commerce, and economics, a customer (sometimes known as a client, buyer, or purchaser) is the recipient of a good, service, product, or an idea, obtained from a seller, vendor, or supplier via a financial transaction or an exchange for money or some other valuable consideration.\n\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nEarly societies relied on a gift economy based on favours. Later, as commerce developed, less permanent human relations were formed, depending more on transitory needs rather than enduring social desires. Customers are generally said to be the purchasers of goods and services, while clients are those who receive personalized advice and solutions. Although such distinctions have no contemporary semantic weight, agencies such as law firms, film studios, and health care providers tend to prefer client, while grocery stores, banks, and restaurants tend to prefer customer instead.\n\n\n=== Client ===\n\nThe term client is derived from Latin clients or care meaning \"to incline\" or \"to bend\", and is related to the emotive idea of closure. It is widely believed that people only change their habits when motivated by greed and fear. Winning a client is therefore a singular event, which is why professional specialists who deal with particular problems tend to attract long-term clients rather than regular customers. Unlike regular customers, who buy merely on price and value, long-term clients buy on experience and trust.\n\n\n=== Customer ===\nClients who habitually return to a seller develop customs that allow for regular, sustained commerce that allows the seller to develop statistical models to optimize production processes (which change the nature or form of goods or services) and supply chains (which change the location or formalize the changes of ownership or entitlement transactions). \nAn \"end customer\" denotes the person at the end of a supply chain who ultimately purchases or utilised the goods or services. ISO principles for quality management note the importance of recognising both direct and indirect customers.\n\n\n=== Employer ===\nA client paying for construction work is often referred to as an \"employer\".\n\n\n== Customer segmentation ==\n\nIn the 21st century, customers are generally categorized into two types:\n\nan entrepreneur or trader (sometimes a commercial Intermediary) - a dealer who purchases goods for re-sale.\nan end user or ultimate customer who does not re-sell the things bought but is the actual consumer or an agent such as a Purchasing officer for the consumer.\nA customer may or may not also be a consumer, but the two notions are distinct.  A customer purchases goods; a consumer uses them.  An ultimate customer may be a consumer as well, but just as equally may have purchased items for someone else to consume.  An intermediate customer is not a consumer at all.  The situation is somewhat complicated in that ultimate customers of so-called industrial goods and services (who are entities such as government bodies, manufacturers, and educational and medical institutions) either themselves use up the goods and services that they buy, or incorporate them into other finished products, and so are technically consumers, too.  However, they are rarely called that, but are rather called industrial customers or business-to-business customers.  Similarly, customers who buy services rather than goods are rarely called consumers.\nSix Sigma doctrine places (active) customers in opposition to two other classes of people: not-customers and non-customers:\n\nCustomers of a given business have actively dealt with that business within a particular recent period that depends on the product sold.\nNot-customers are either past customers who are no longer customers or potential customers who choose to interact with the competition.\nNon-customers are people who are active in a different market segment entirely.\nGeoff Tennant, a Six Sigma consultant from the United Kingdom, uses the following analogy to explain the difference:  A supermarket's customer is the person buying milk at that supermarket; a not-customer buys milk from a competing supermarket, whereas a non-customer does not buy milk from supermarkets at all but rather \"has milk delivered to the door in the traditional British way\".\nTennant also categorizes customers in another way that is employed outside the fields of marketing.  While marketers, market regulation, and economists use the intermediate/ultimate categorization, the field of customer service more often categorizes customers into two classes:\n\nAn external customer of an organization is a customer who is not directly connected to that organization.\nAn internal customer is a customer who is directly connected to an organization, and is usually (but not necessarily) internal to the organization.  Internal customers are usually stakeholders, employees, or shareholders, but the definition also encompasses creditors and external regulators.\nBefore the introduction of the notion of an internal customer, external customers were, simply, customers. Quality-management writer Joseph M. Juran popularized the concept, introducing it in 1988 in the fourth edition of his Quality Control Handbook (Juran 1988).  The idea has since gained wide acceptance in the literature on total quality management and service marketing; and many organizations as of 2016 recognize the customer satisfaction of internal customers as a precursor to, and a prerequisite for, external customer satisfaction, with authors such as Tansuhaj, Randall & McCullough 1991 regarding service organizations which design products for internal customer satisfaction as better able to satisfy the needs of external customers. Research on the theory and practice of managing the internal customer continues as of 2016 in a variety of service-sector industries.\n\n\n=== Arguments against use of the term \"internal customers\" ===\nLeading authors in management and marketing, like Peter Drucker, Philip Kotler, W. Edwards Deming, etc., have not used the term \"internal customer\" in their works. They consider the \"customer\" as a very specific role in society which represents a crucial part in the relationship between the demand and the supply. Some of the most important characteristics of any customer are that: any customer is never in a subordination line with any supplier; any customer has equal positions with the supplier within negotiations, and any customer can accept or reject any offer for a service or a product. Peter Drucker wrote, \"They are all people who can say no, people who have the choice to accept or reject what you offer.\"\nIn opposition to the stated customer's characteristics, relationships between colleagues in a company are always based on subordination – direct or indirect. Company employees are obliged to follow the processes of their companies. Company employees do not have the authority to choose a unit/colleague to fulfill any task. Company employees are obliged to use an existing unit/colleague by using the company's structure and approved processes, therefore these internal relationships are not considered as an option.\nMany authors in ITIL and Six Sigma methodologies define \"internal customer\" as an internal part of a company that uses the output of another part of a company as its input. But actually, this definition describes better a classical internal process rather than a relationship between a customer and a supplier. Peter Drucker considers that there are no customers inside organizations. He wrote \"Inside an organization, there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced.\" In addition, William Deming advises managers, in his 9th point, to \"Break down barriers between departments. They must work as a team\", which means that there have to be teamwork in a company rather than a supplier/customer relationship. One more argument, even the ITIL methodology admits that \"the term 'colleague' may be more accurate in describing how two internal groups are related to one another.\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nClient (business)\nCustomer advocacy\nCustomer centricity\nCustomer data integration\nCustomer delight\nCustomer relationship management\nEarly adopter\nGuided selling\nProcurement\nService level agreement\nThe customer is always right\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n=== References ===\nBlythe, Jim (2008).

        "content": "The American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is an economic indicator that measures the satisfaction of consumers across the U.S. economy. It is produced by the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI LLC) based in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nThe ACSI interviews about 350,000 customers annually and asks about their satisfaction with the goods and services they have purchased and consumed. Respondents are screened to ensure inclusion of actual customers of a wide range of business-to-consumer products and services, including durable goods, services, non-durable goods, local government services, federal government services, and so forth. Customer satisfaction (ACSI) scores are released monthly throughout each calendar year. ACSI data is used by researchers, corporations, government agencies, market analysts and investors, industry trade associations, and consumers.\n\n\n== History ==\nACSI began in 1994, developed by researchers with the National Quality Research Center at the University of Michigan, in cooperation with the American Society for Quality and CFI Group, Inc. The model was originally designed in 1989 for the Swedish economy (the Swedish Customer Satisfaction Barometer (SCSB)). Both the Swedish version and the ACSI were developed by Claes Fornell, Donald C. Cook Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Business Administration at the University of Michigan, and chairman of CFI Group.\n\n\n== ACSI score calculation ==\nA company's ACSI score is derived from three manifest variables (i.e. survey questions) within the ACSI questionnaire, each rated on a 1-10 scale by the respondents interviewed for that company, government agency, or other organization:\n\nThe 0-100 ACSI score is estimated using the mean for each variable from the n responses for that company (X1, X2, X3), along with the weights for each question as calculated within the ACSI structural equation model (W1, W2, W3):\n\n(((X1*W1)+(X2*W2)+(X3*W3))-1)/9*100\n\n\n== Sector, industry and company-level findings ==\nACSI data show that certain sectors, industries and companies have consistently high customer satisfaction, while others are almost always below average (with the National ACSI score reflecting the average). At the sector level, manufacturing — including both durable and non-durable goods — typically \nSome industries that are measured performed well over the years in ACSI include: e-commerce, personal care products, soft drinks, beer, consumer electronics, automobiles and household appliances. Cable television, airlines and telecommunications usually have lower ACSI scores.\n\n\n== Macroeconomic findings ==\nOne set of findings discovered by academic researchers involve predictions of macroeconomic growth as functions of changes in aggregate customer satisfaction. For example, ACSI is predictive of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth and Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) growth.\n\n\n== Stock market findings ==\nIn a 2006 paper published in the Journal of Marketing, it was shown that a portfolio of stocks chosen based on their customer satisfaction outperformed the market. A 2016 article in the same journal, examining returns from a fund trading exclusively on ACSI data, found that strong satisfaction companies significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (518% to 31%) during the study period (2000-2014).\n\n\n== International adoption of the ACSI model ==\nResearch groups, quality associations and universities in several countries are using the ACSI model to create customer satisfaction indices for their own national economies. The list of governments that have adopted the ACSI model include India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Dubai, Kuwait, South Africa, Honduras, Puerto Rico, and Colombia. The development of an international system of customer satisfaction measurement founded on a common methodology allows for comprehensive cross-national satisfaction benchmarking.\n\n\n== ACSI licensees ==\nIn addition to ACSI LLC, CFI Group LLC is licensed to apply the methodology for individual companies. ACSI Funds, which manages an exchange-traded fund (ETF), uses ACSI data for trading under the ticker symbol \"ACSI\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Australian Customer Satisfaction Index\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index\nNational Quality Research Center (self-description, includes the ACSI)\nNational Business Research Institute\nThe South African Customer Satisfaction Index",

        "content": "Customer service is the assistance and advice provided by a company to those who buy or use its products or services, either in person or remotely. Customer service is often practiced in a way that reflects the strategies and values of a firm, and levels vary according to the industry. Good quality customer service is usually measured through customer retention. Successful customer service interactions are dependent on employees \"who can adjust themselves to the personality of the customer\".\nCustomer service in some cases is part of the firm's intangible assets and can differentiate it from others in the industry. One good customer service experience can change the entire perception a customer holds towards the organization. It is expected that AI-based chatbots will significantly impact customer service and call centre roles and will increase productivity substantially. Many organisations have already adopted AI chatbots to improve their customer service experience.\nThe evolution in the service industry has identified the needs of consumers. Companies usually create policies or standards to guide their personnel to follow their particular service package. A service package is a combination of tangible and intangible characteristics a firm uses to take care of its clients.\n\n\n== Customer support ==\n\nCustomer support is a range of consumer services to assist customers in making cost-effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product. These services may even be provided at the place in which the customer makes use of the product or service. In this case, it is called \"at home customer service\" or \"at home customer support.\" Customer support is an effective strategy that ensures that the customer's needs have been attended to. Customer support helps ensure that the products and services that have been provided to the customer meet their expectations. When receiving an effective and efficient customer support experience, customers tend to be loyal to the organization, which creates a competitive advantage over its competitors. Organizations should ensure that any complaints from customers about customer support have been dealt with effectively.\n\n\n== Automation and productivity increase ==\nCustomer service may be provided in person (e.g. sales / service representative), or by automated means, such as kiosks, websites, and apps. An advantage of automation is that it can provide service 24 hours a day which can complement face-to-face customer service. There is also economic benefit to the firm. Through the evolution of technology, automated services become less expensive over time. This helps provide services to more customers for a fraction of the cost of employees' wages. Automation can facilitate customer service or replace it entirely.\nA popular type of automated customer service is done through artificial intelligence (AI). The customer benefit of AI is the feel for chatting with a live agent through improved speech technologies while giving customers the self-service benefit.  AI can learn through interaction to give a personalized service. The exchange the Internet of Things (IoT) facilitates within devices, lets us transfer data when we need it, where we need it. Each gadget catches the information it needs while it maintains communication with other devices. This is also done through advances in hardware and software technology. Another form of automated customer service is touch-tone phone, which usually involves IVR (Interactive Voice Response) a main menu and the use of a keypad as options (e.g. \"Press 1 for English, Press 2 for Spanish\").\nIn the Internet era, a challenge is to maintain and/or enhance the personal experience while making use of the efficiencies of online commerce. \"Online customers are literally invisible to you (and you to them), so it's easy to shortchange them emotionally. But this lack of visual and tactile presence makes it even more crucial to create a sense of personal, human-to-human connection in the online arena.\"\n\nExamples of customer service by artificial means are automated online assistants that can be seen as avatars on websites, which enterprises can use to reduce operating and training costs. These are driven by chatbots, and a major underlying technology to such systems is natural language processing. \n\n\n== Metrics ==\nThe two primary methods of gathering feedback are customer surveys and Net Promoter Score measurement, used for calculating the loyalty that exists between a provider and a consumer.\n\n\n== Instant feedback ==\nMany outfits have implemented feedback loops that allow them to capture feedback at the point of experience. For example, National Express in the UK has invited passengers to send text messages while riding the bus. This has been shown to be useful, as it allows companies to improve their customer service before the customer defects, thus making it far more likely that the customer will return next time.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n \n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKrishnan, C., Gupta, A., Gupta, A., Singh, G.

        "content": "Customer feedback management (CFM) online services are web applications that allow businesses to manage user suggestions and complaints in a structured fashion. A 2011 study conducted by Aberdeen Group showed that companies using customer feedback management services and social media monitoring have a 15% better customer retention rate.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nVarious online CFM services use different approaches. The aim of most methodologies is to measure customer satisfaction, with some models also measuring related constructs including customer loyalty and customer word-of-mouth (see Webreep model). The methodology behind each service has an important impact on the nature of the service itself, and is the main differentiator between them. The main feedback management methodologies are listed below.\n\n\n=== Feedback analytics ===\nFeedback analytics services use customer generated feedback data to measure customer experience and improve customer satisfaction. Feedback data is collected, then, using key performance indicators and feedback metrics, turned into actionable information for website improvement. Feedback analytics services provide website owners with the ability to create feedback forms that can be customized to fit the website and placed on all pages. This allows the website's users to submit feedback when they encounter a problem or have a feature request. A feedback button is visible at all times on each of the site's pages. Feedback analytics provide page- and website- level actionable data, and enable a website owner to read and manage feedback, as well as to get back to the users. The feedback is only made accessible to the website owner. This means that websites using feedback analytics are not exposed to the potential harm to their brand that feedback made public may cause. Feedback collection can be passive (using a feedback button), or active (using a feedback form set to appear in certain conditions), or both.  The ability to choose the location of the button, as well as the frequency and conditions of the pop-up make feedback analytics a relatively non-intrusive approach from the point of view of the website user. Due to its measurable nature, feedback analytics data can be integrated with web analytics data, allowing website owners to understand what their users are doing on their site (using web analytics) and why they do it (using feedback analytics), in one single interface.\n\n\n=== Customer feedback optimization ===\nAlso referred to as review forum optimization or RFO. Similar to SEO, CFO is the process of affecting the visibility of select web pages or results in the natural or un-paid results of various customer feedback management services or online review forums. CFO stands for customer feedback optimization, thus the sites being optimized are those for the review, ranking, and giving feedback of goods and or services by customers. In recent years review forums or customer feedback management services have been growing rapidly in influence, with 83% of consumers saying online reviews influence their perception of a company.\n In addition, a study states that, consumers were willing to pay between 20 percent and 99 percent more for an Excellent (5 star) rating than for a Good (4 star rating), depending on the product category.\n\nSome commonly known review forums are Yelp (20 million visits in February 2013), Trip Advisor (10 million visits in February 2013), Travelocity (3.7 million visits in February 2013), and Angie's List (3.4 million visits in February 2013).\n\n\n== Feature comparison ==\nBelow is a comparison of notable customer feedback management services.\nLegend:\n\nWho voted: displays the users who voted on an item, but not each user's vote\nHuman friendly URLs: /product/Suggestion_name. Human-unfriendly URLs: /akira/dtd/6320-2416, /pages/general/suggestions/7841\nMerge suggestions: more than deleting duplicate suggestions, merging adds votes from the merged suggestion into the main one\nCustom URL: DNS aliasing  a subdomain like feedback.mycompany.com to the subdomain of the online feedback service (e.g. mycompany.cfmsite.com)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer experience\nEnterprise feedback management\nInteractive customer evaluation\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A customer review is an evaluation of a product or service made by someone who has purchased and used, or had experience with, a product or service. Customer reviews are a form of customer feedback on electronic commerce and online shopping sites. There are also dedicated review sites, some of which use customer reviews as well as or instead of professional reviews. The reviews may themselves be graded for usefulness or accuracy by other users.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the arrival of the internet, customers could review products and services through customer comment boxes and customer service helplines. These methods still exist today although internet review sites are used more in recent years.\n\n\n== Reliability ==\nThe reliability of customer reviews has been questioned. Abuses akin to ballot stuffing of favourable reviews by the seller (known as incentivized reviews), or negative reviews by competitors, need to be policed by the review host site. Indeed, gathering fake reviews has become big business. In 2012, for example, fake book reviews have been revealed as significantly affecting ratings on Amazon. In 2016 Amazon banned the practice of reviewing complimentary products, researchers have shown that the process still continued as of 2021, but without any disclosures.\nSince few sites restrict users to reviewing only items they have actually purchased, it is difficult to know if a customer is real, has actually used the product they are reviewing, and is giving honest, unbiased feedback about the product or services being reviewed. Tools like Fakespot and ReviewMeta can help spot fake reviews on shopping sites like Amazon. Unfortunately, the tools do not work on most other websites that show customer reviews.\nPublic calls have been growing stronger, demanding that review sites be held accountable for publishing fake reviews. Most recently (June 2021), the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in the United Kingdom has launched an investigation into whether Amazon and Google are doing enough to prevent fake reviews from being published on their sites. Both businesses claim to have sufficient resources and policies in place to prevent fake reviews from being published. Legal steps could be taken against the giants if CMA determines those claims to be false. The problem has become so widespread that in 2023, the FTC announced plans to ban fake reviews and testimonials.\nWhether a customer receives an invitation or not, many businesses have expressed the wish that customers let the business know in the moment if some aspect of their interaction or product is unsatisfactory, so they can have the opportunity to fix it on the spot or provide compensation, rather than customers leaving unnecessarily disappointed and writing negative reviews.\n\n\n=== Fake review scandals ===\nIn 2010, British historian Orlando Figes posted reviews on Amazon praising his own work and criticizing that of his rivals.\nIn August 2012, The New York Times revealed that John Locke had paid an online service to write reviews of his books, in order to artificially boost sales.\nIn 2022, researchers from UCLA documented that millions of Amazon sellers purchase fake 5-star reviews through private Facebook groups.\n\n\n=== Spoof reviews ===\n\nHumorous customer reviews are common on some major shopping sites, such as Amazon. These are often ironically or sarcastically praising reviews of products deemed kitsch or mundane. Another example is methylated spirits described in the style of a wine review. A product may become an internet meme attracting large numbers of spoof reviews, which may boost its sales. Famous examples include Tuscan Whole Milk and the Three Wolf Moon T-shirt.\nExamples of spoof reviews include:\n\nA Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates (book)\nf.lux (display color adjustment software based on the time of day)\nOsama Bin Laden's Hideout Compound (humorous reviews of Osama bin Laden's hideout compound written by Google Maps users after his killing on 1 May 2011)\nUranium Ore\n\"BIC Cristal For Her Ball Pen\"\nBritish spoofers have targeted several build to order novelty products made by Media Storehouse from two million licensed photo library images, including a canvas print of minor celebrity Paul Ross, and a jigsaw puzzle of Nick Humby, a former finance director of Manchester United.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Customer experience (CX) refers to the cognitive, emotional, sensory, and behavioral responses of a customer during all stages of interaction with a product or service, including pre-purchase, consumption, and post-purchase.\nDifferent dimensions of customer experience include senses, emotions, feelings, perceptions, cognitive evaluations, involvement, memories, as well as spiritual components, and behavioral intentions. The pre-consumption anticipation experience can be described as the amount of pleasure or displeasure received from savoring future events, while the remembered experience is related to a recollection of memories about previous events and experiences of a product or service.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nAccording to Forrester Research (via Fast Company), the foundational elements of a remarkable customer experience consist of six key disciplines, beginning with strategy, customer understanding, design, measurement, governance and culture. A company's ability to deliver an experience that sets it apart in the eyes of its customers will increase the amount of consumer spending with the company and inspire loyalty to its brand. According to Jessica Sebor, \"Loyalty is now driven primarily by a company's interaction with its customers and how well it delivers on their wants and needs\".\nBarbara E. Kahn, Wharton's Professor of Marketing, has established an evolutional approach to customer experience as the third of four stages of any company in terms of its customer centricity maturity. These progressive phases are:\n\nProduct orientation: Companies manufacture goods and offer them in the best way possible.\nMarket orientation: Some consideration of customer needs and segmentation arises, developing different marketing mix bundles for each one.\nCustomer experience: Adding to the other two factors some recognition of the importance of providing an emotionally positive experience to customers.\nAuthenticity: This is the most mature stage for companies. Products and services emerge from the real soul of the brand and connect naturally with clients and other stakeholders, for a long-term.\nIn today's competitive climate, more than just low prices and innovative products are required to survive in the retail business. Customer experience involves every point of contact you have with a customer and the interactions with the products or services of the business. Customer experience has emerged as a vital strategy for all retail businesses that are facing competition. According to Holbrook & Hirschman studies (1982) customer experience can be defined as a whole event that a customer comes into contact with when interacting with a certain business. This experience often affects the emotions of the customer. The whole experience occurs when the interaction takes place through the stimulation of goods and services consumed.\nIn 1994 Steve Haeckel and Lou Carbone further refined the original concept and collaborated on a seminal early article on experience management, titled \"Engineering Customer Experiences\", where they defined experience as \"the 'take-away' impression formed by people's encounters with products, services and businesses — a perception produced when humans consolidate sensory information.\" They argued that the new approach must focus on total experience as the key customer value proposition.\nThe type of experience seen through a marketing perspective is put forward by Pine & Gilmore which they state that an experience can be unique which may mean different individuals will not have the same level of experience that may not be memorable to the person, therefore, it won't be remembered over a period of time. Certain types of experiences may involve different aspects of the individual person such as emotional, physical, intellectual or even spiritual.\nCustomer experience is the stimulation a company creates for the senses of the consumers, this means that the companies and that particular brand can control the stimuli that they have given to the consumer's senses which the companies can then control the consumers' reaction resulting from the stimulation process, giving more acquisition of the customer experience as expected by company.\nKotler et al. 2013, (p. 283) say that customer experience is about, \"Adding value for customers buying products and services through customer participation and connection, by managing all aspects of the encounter\". The encounter includes touchpoints. Businesses can create and modify touchpoints so that they are suited to their consumers which change/enhance the customers' experience. Creating an experience for the customer can lead to greater brand loyalty and brand recognition in the form of logos, colour, smell, touch, taste, etc.\nHowever, customer experience management, and in particular design for experiences, is not only relevant for the private sector but also increasingly important in the public sector, especially in the age of digitalization where public service users cocreate value by integrating resources from multiple sources. In this context, organizations need to not only understand their service users but also the network of actors and how public services fit into the wider value constellation and people's activities.\n\n\n== Realms of customer experience ==\nCustomer experience is divided into realms and domains by various scholars. Pine and Gilmore introduced four realms of experience include esthetic, escapist, entertainment, and educational components.\nEntertainment Realm: In this realm, businesses create experiences that captivate customers by providing entertainment and amusement. It goes beyond traditional products or services, aiming to engage and delight customers through memorable and immersive experiences.\nEducational Realm: This realm focuses on educating customers and enhancing their knowledge during their interactions with a brand. It involves providing valuable information, insights, and learning opportunities, fostering a sense of personal growth and understanding.\nEsthetic Realm: The esthetic realm emphasizes the visual and sensory aspects of the customer experience. It involves creating visually appealing and sensory-rich environments, products, or services that stimulate the senses and elicit positive emotional responses.\nEscapist Realm: In this realm, businesses offer customers an escape from their everyday lives. It involves creating experiences that transport customers to different worlds or realities, allowing them to temporarily disconnect from their usual routines and responsibilities.\n\n\n== Designing customer experience ==\nThere are many elements in the shopping experience associated with a customer's experience. Customer service, a brand's ethical ideals and the shopping environment are examples of factors that affect a customer's experience. Understanding and effectively developing a positive customer experience has become a staple within businesses and brands to combat growing competition (Andajani, 2015). Many consumers are well informed, they are able to easily compare two similar products or services together. Therefore, consumers are looking for experiences that can fulfil their intentions(Ali, 2015). A brand that can provide this gains a competitive advantage over its competition. A study by Ali (2015) found that developing a positive behavioural culture created a greater competitive advantage in the long term. He looked at the customer experience at resort hotels and discovered that providing the best hotel service was not sufficient. To optimise a customer's experience, management must also consider the peace of mind and relaxation, recognition and escapism, involvement, and hedonics. The overall customer experience must be considered. The development of a positive customer experience is important as it increases the chances of a customer to make continued purchases and develops brand loyalty (Kim & Yu, 2016). Brand loyalty can turn customers into advocates, resulting in a long term relationship between both parties (Ren, Wang & Lin, 2016). This promotes word-of-mouth and turns the customer into a touchpoint for the brand. Potential customers can develop opinions through another's experiences. Males and females both respond differently to brands and therefore, will experience the same brand differently. Males respond effectively to relational, behavioural and cognitive experiences whereas females respond greater to behavioural, cognitive and effective experiences in relation to branded apps. If female consumers are the target market, an app advert focused on the emotion of the product will provide an effective customer experience (Kim & Yu, 2016).\nToday, retail stores tend to exist in shopping areas such as malls or shopping districts. Very few operate in areas alone (Tynan, McKechnie & Hartly, 2014). Customer experience is not limited to the purchase alone. It includes all activities that may influence a customer's experience with a brand (Andajani, 2015). Therefore, a shopping centre's reputation that a store is located in will affect a brand's customer experience. At the same time, it is important to provide a seamless integrated experience that goes beyond individual transactions and enhances overall brand perception. This is an example of the shopping environment affecting a customer's experience. A study by Hart, Stachow and Cadogan (2013) found that a consumer's opinion of a town centre can affect the opinion of the retail stores operating within both negatively and positively. They shared an example of a town centre's management team developing synergy between the surrounding location and the retail stores. A location bound with historical richness could provide an opportunity for the town centre and local businesses to connect at a deeper level with their customers. They suggested that town centre management and retail outlets should work cooperatively to develop an effective customer experience. This will result in all stores benefiting from customer retention and loyalty.\nAnother effective way to develop a positive customer experience is by actively engaging a customer with an activity. Human and physical components of an experience are very important (Ren, Wang & Lin, 201 6). Customers are able to recall active, hands-on experiences much more effectively and accurately than passive activities. This is because customers in these moments are per definition the 'experts of use'. Participants within a study were able to recount previous luxury driving experiences due to its high involvement. However, this can also have a negative effect on the customer's experience. Just as active, hands-on experiences can greatly develop value creation, they can also greatly facilitate value destruction (Tynan, McKechnie & Hartly, 2014). This is related to a customer's satisfaction with their experience. By understanding what causes satisfaction or dissatisfaction with a customer's experience, management can appropriately implement changes within their approach (Ren, Wang & Lin, 2016). A study on the customer experience in budget hotels revealed interesting results. Customer satisfaction was largely influenced by tangible and sensory dimensions. This included cleanliness, shower comfort, and room temperature, just to name a few. As budget hotels are cheap, customers expected the basic elements to be satisfactory and the luxury elements to be non-existent. If these dimensions did not reach an appropriate standard, satisfaction would decline, resulting in a negative experience (Ren, Wang & Lin, 20 16).\n\n\n== Customer experience management ==\n\nCustomer experience management (CEM or CXM) is the process that companies use to oversee and track all interactions with a customer during their relationship. This involves the strategy of building around the needs of individual customers. According to Jeananne Rae, companies are realizing that \"building great consumer experiences is a complex enterprise, involving strategy, integration of technology, orchestrating business models, brand management and CEO commitment\".\nIn 2020, the global CEM market was valued at $7.54 billion, and is expected to grow with a CAGR of 17.5% from 2021-2028. Top companies in the customer experience industry include:\n\nAdobe\nClarabridge\nMedallia\nNetSuite\nOracle\nTech Mahindra\nZendesk\nAccording to Bernd Schmitt, \"the term 'Customer Experience Management' represents the discipline, methodology and/or process used to comprehensively manage a customer's cross-channel exposure, interaction and transaction with a company, product, brand or service.\" Harvard Business Review blogger Adam Richardson says that a company must define and understand all dimensions of the customer experience in order to have long-term success.\nAlthough 80% of businesses state that they offer a \"great customer experience,\" according to author James Allen, this contrasts with the 8% of customers expressing satisfaction with their experience. Allen asserts that for companies to meet the demands of providing an exceptional customer experience, they must be able to execute the \"Three Ds\":\n\ndesigning the correct incentive for the correctly identified consumer, offered in an enticing environment\ndelivery: a company's ability to focus the entire team across various functions to deliver the proposed experience\ndevelopment ultimately determines a company's success, with an emphasis on developing consistency in execution\nCEM has been recognized as the future of the customer service and sales industry. Companies are using this approach to anticipate customer needs and adopt the mindset of the customer.\nCEM depicts a business strategy designed to manage the customer experience and gives benefits to both retailers and customers. CEM can be monitored through surveys, targeted studies, observational studies, or \"voice of customer\" research. It captures the instant response of the customer to its encounters with the brand or company. Customer surveys, customer contact data, internal operations process and quality data, and employee input are all sources of \"voice of customer\" data that can be used to quantify the cost of inaction on customer experience issues.\nThe aim of CEM is to optimize the customer experience by gaining the loyalty of the current customers in a multi-channel environment and ensuring they are completely satisfied. Its also to create advocates of their current customers with potential customers as a word of mouth form of marketing. However, common efforts at improving CEM can have the opposite effect.\nUtilizing surroundings includes using visuals, displays and interactivity to connect with customers and create an experience (Kotler, et al. 2013, p. 283). CEM can be related to customer journey mapping, a concept pioneered by Ron Zemke and Chip Bell. Customer journey mapping is a design tool used to track customers' movements through different touchpoints with the business in question. It maps out the first encounters people may have with the brand and shows the different routes people can take through the different channels or marketing (e.g. online, television, magazine, newspaper). Integrated marketing communications (IMC) is also being used to manage the customer experience; IMC is about sending a consistent message amongst all platforms; these platforms include: Advertising, personal selling, public relations, direct marketing, and sales promotion (Kotler et al. 2013, (p. 283), p. 495).\nCEM holds great importance in terms of research and showing that academia is not as applicable and usable as the practice behind it. Typically, to make the best use of CEM and ensure its accuracy, the customer journey must be viewed from the actual perspective of customers, not the business or organization. It needs to be noted that there isn't a specific set of rules or steps to follow as companies (in their various industries) will have different strategies. Therefore, development into the conceptual and theoretical aspects is needed, based on customers' perspectives on the brand experience. This can be seen through different scholarly research. The reasoning behind the interest in CEM increasing so significantly is because businesses are looking for competitive differentiation. Businesses want to be more profitable and see this as a means to do so. Hence why businesses want to offer a better experience to their customers and want to manage this process efficiently. In order to gain success as a business customers need to be understood. In order to fully utilise the models used in practice, academic research that is conducted can assist the practical aspect. This along with recognising past customer experiences can help manage future experiences.\nA good indicator of customer satisfaction is the Net Promoter Score (NPS). This indicates out of a score of ten if a customer would recommend a business to other people. With scores of nine and ten these people are called protractors and will recommend others to the given product but on the other end of the spectrum are detractors, those who give the score of zero to six. Subtracting the detractors from the protractors gives the calculation of advocacy. Those businesses with higher scores are likely to be more successful and give a better customer experience.\nNot all aspects of CEM can be controlled by the business (e.g. other people and the influence they have). Besides, there is not much substantial information to support CEM claims in terms of academic research. The use of artificial intelligence in customer experience has slowly been increasing in recent years. Chatbots are often seen as the first phase of this development.\n\n\n=== Managing the communication ===\nThe classical linear communication model includes having one sender or source sending out a message that goes through the media (television, magazines) and then to the receiver. The classical linear model is a form of mass marketing that targets a large number of people where only a few may be customers; this is a form of non-personal communication (Dahlen, et al. 2010, p. 39). The adjusted model shows the source sending a message either to the media or directly to an opinion leader/s and/or opinion former (Model, actress, credible source, trusted figure in society, YouTuber/reviewer), which sends a decoded message to the receiver (Dahlen et al. 2010, p. 39). The adjusted model is a form of interpersonal communication where feedback is almost instantaneous with receiving the message. The adjusted model means that there are many more platforms of marketing with the use of social media, which connects people with more touchpoints. Marketers use the digital experience to enhance the customer experience (Dahlen et al. 2010, p. 40). Enhancing digital experiences influences changes to the CEM, the customer journey map and IMC. The adjusted model allows marketers to communicate a message designed specifically for the 'followers' of the particular opinion leader or opinion former, sending a personalised message and creating a digital experience.\n\n\n=== Persuasion techniques ===\n\nPersuasion techniques are used when trying to send a message in order for an experience to take place. Marcom Projects (2007) came up with five mind shapers to show how humans view things. The five mind shapers of persuasion include:\n\nFrames – only showing what they want you to see (a paid ad post)\nSetting and context – the surrounding objects of items for sale\nFilters – previous beliefs that shape thoughts after an interaction\nSocial influence – how behaviours of others impact us\nBelief (placebo effect) – the expectation\nMind shapers can be seen through the use of the adjusted communication model, it allows the source/sender to create a perception for the receiver (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p. 39).\nMind shapers can take two routes for persuasion:\n\nCentral route, this route requires a thought process to occur, the content of the message is important. People think thoroughly about their reaction/reply. This can be seen in the purchase of homes, Internet providers, insurance companies.\nPeripheral route, does not require very much thought, the brain makes the connection. Marketers use recognisable cues like logos, colours and sounds. This type of marketing is used when the decision is about something simple like choosing a drink, food (Petty & Cacioppo, 1981).\nMarketers can use human thought processes and target these to create greater experiences, they can do so by either making the process more simple and creating interactive steps to help the process (Campbell & Kirmani, 2000).\n\n\n== Customer relationship management ==\nAccording to Das (2007), customer relationship management (CRM) is the \"establishment, development, maintenance and optimization of long-term mutually valuable relationships between consumers and organizations\". The official definition of CRM by the Customer Relationship Management Research Center is \"a strategy used to learn more about the customers' needs and behaviours in order to develop stronger relationships with them\". The purpose of this strategy is to change the approach to customers and improve the experience for the consumer by making the supplier more aware of their buying habits and frequencies.\nThe D4 Company Analysis is an audit tool that considers the four aspects of strategy, people, technology and processes in the design of a CRM strategy. The analysis includes four main steps.\n\n\"Define the existing customer relationship management processes within the company.\nDetermine the perceptions of how the company manages its customer relationships, both internally and externally.\nDesign the ideal customer relationship management solutions relative to the company or industry.\nDeliver a strategy for the implementation of the recommendations based on the findings\".\n\n\n== User experience ==\nIn the classical marketing model, marketing is deemed to be a funnel: at the beginning of the process (in the \"awareness\" stage) there are many branches competing for the attention of the customer, and this number is reduced through the different purchasing stages. Marketing is an action of \"pushing\" the brand through a few touchpoints (for example through TV ads).\nSince the rise of the World Wide Web and smartphone applications, there are many more touchpoints from new content serving platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube etc.), individual online presences (such as websites, forums, blogs, etc.) and dedicated smartphone applications.\nAs a result, this process has become a type of \"journey\":\n\nThe number of brands does not decrease during the process of evaluating and purchasing a product.\nBrands not taken into account in the \"awareness\" stage may be added during the evaluation or even purchase stage\nFollowing the post-purchase stage, there is a return to the first step in the process, thus feeding the brand awareness.\nIn relation to customers and the channels which are associated with sales, these are multichannel in nature. Due to the growth and importance of social media and digital advancement, these aspects need to be understood by businesses to be successful in this era of customer journeys. With tools such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter having such prominence, there is a constant stream of data that needs to be analysed to understand this journey. Business flexibility and responsiveness are vital in the ever-changing digital customer environment, as customers are constantly connected to businesses and their products. Customers are now instant product experts due to various digital outlets and form their own opinions on how and where to consume products and services. Businesses use customer values and create a plan to gain a competitive advantage. Businesses use the knowledge of customers to guide the customer journey to their products and services.\nDue to the shift in customer experience, in 2014 Wolny & Charoensuksai highlight three behaviours that show how decisions can be made in this digital journey. The Zero Moment of truth is the first interaction a customer has in connection with a service or product. This moment affects the consumer's choice to explore a product further or not at all. These moments can occur on any digital device. Showrooming highlights how a consumer will view a product in a physical store but then decide to exit the store empty handed and buy online instead. This consumer decision may be due to the ability to compare multiple prices online. On the opposing end of the spectrum is webrooming. Consumers will research a product online in regards to quality and price but then decide to purchase in store. These three channels need to be understood by businesses because customers expect businesses to be readily available to cater to their specific customer needs and purchasing behaviours.\n\n\n== Customer journey ==\nIn marketing, the notion of customer journey portrays the process customers go through to establish a commercial relationship with a firm. The journey emphasizes touchpoints, which are the moments in which firms can interact with their current or potential customers. Managers use visualizations called customer journey mapping (CJM) to represent the sequences of interactions between firms and customers to identify opportunities for interaction. Understanding CJM also allows for corporations to reduce \"friction\", or potential issues for the customer.\nCJM has subsequently become one of the most widely used tools for service design and has been utilized as a tool for visualizing intangible services. A customer journey map shows the story of the customer's experience. It not only identifies key interactions that the customer has with the organization, but it also brings the user's feelings, motivations, and questions for each of the touchpoints. Finally, a customer journey map has the objective of teaching organizations more about their customers. To map a customer journey is important to consider the company's customers (buyer persona), the customer journey's time frame, channels (telephone, email, in-app messages, social media, forums, recommendations), first actions (problem acknowledgment), and last actions (recommendations or subscription renewal). Customer Journey Maps are good storytelling conduits – they communicate to the brand the journey, along with the emotional quotient, that the customer experiences at every stage of the buyer journey.\nCustomer journey maps take into account people's mental models (how things should behave), the flow of interactions, and possible touchpoints. They may combine user profiles, scenarios, and user flows; and reflect the thought patterns, processes, considerations, paths, and experiences that people go through in their daily lives.\n\n\n=== Benefits ===\nMapping the customer journey helps organizations understand how prospects and customers use the various channels and [touchpoints], how the organization is perceived, and how the organization would like its customers and prospects' experiences to be. By understanding the latter, it is possible to design an optimal experience that meets the expectations of major customer groups, achieves competitive advantage, and supports the attainment of desired customer experience objectives. Increased customer retention is another benefit of a carefully designed and executed customer experience strategy.\nJourney mapping or journey orchestration has recently benefitted from the growth of AI technology. Solutions have become available in the last decade which allow AI to enhance complex customer journeys. Until recently, all customer journey mapping was human-led, but we are currently experiencing a rise of artificial intelligence in customer experience.\n\n\n== Sales experience ==\nRetail environment factors include social features, design, and ambiance. This can result in enhanced pleasure while shopping, thus a positive customer experience and more likely chances of the customer revisiting the store in the future. The same retail environment may produce varied outcomes and emotions, depending on what the consumer is looking for. For example, a crowded retail environment may be exciting for a consumer seeking entertainment, but create an impression of inattentive customer service and frustration to a consumer who may need help looking for a specific product to meet an immediate need.\nEnvironmental stimuli such as lighting and music can influence a consumer's decision to stay longer in the store, therefore increasing the chances of purchasing. For example, a retail store may have dim lights and soothing music which may lead a consumer to experience the store as relaxing and calming.\nToday's consumers are consistently connected through the development of technological innovation in the retail environment. This has led to the increased use of digital-led experiences in their purchase journey both in-store and online that inspire and influence the sales process. For example, Rebecca Minkoff has installed smart mirrors in their fitting rooms that allow the customers to browse for products that may complement what they are trying on. These mirrors also hold an extra feature, a self-checkout system where the customer places the item on an RFID-powered table, which then sends the products to an iPad that is used to check out.\nExternal and internal variables in a retail environment can also affect a consumer's decision to visit the store. External variables include window displays such as posters and signage, or product exposure that can be seen by the consumer from outside of the store. Internal variables include flooring, decoration and design. These attributes of a retail environment can either encourage or discourage a consumer from approaching the store.\nSales experience is a subset of the customer experience. Whereas customer experience encompasses the sum of all interactions between an organization and a customer over the entire relationship, sales experience is focused exclusively on the interactions that take place during the sales process and up to the point that a customer decides to buy.\nCustomer experience tends to be owned by the marketing function within an organization, and therefore has little control or focus on what happens before a customer decides to buy.\nSales experience is concerned with the buyer's journey up to and including the point that the buyer makes a purchase decision. Sales is a very important touch-point for overall customer experience as this is where the most human interaction takes place.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConsumer behavior\nExperience economy\nExperience model\nUser experience\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategic process that organizations use to manage, analyze, and improve their interactions with customers. By using data-driven insights, CRM helps businesses optimize communication, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.\nCRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone (which many services come with a softphone), email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media. They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to better cater to their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth. CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviours, from the perspective of the company.\nThe global customer relationship management market size is projected to grow from $101.41 billion in 2024 to $262.74 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.6% \n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking. At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. One of the best-known precursors of modern-day CRM is the Farley File. Developed by Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager, James Farley, the Farley File was a comprehensive set of records detailing political and personal facts about people FDR and Farley met or were supposed to meet. Using it, people that FDR met were impressed by his \"recall\" of facts about their family and what they were doing professionally and politically. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestenbaum introduced the concept of database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data. By 1987, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney had released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of a digital Rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.\nThe trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize lead potential, including Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, who designed the first CRM product, Siebel Customer Relationship Management, in 1993. In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions, established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, Zoho Corporation, SAP, Peoplesoft (an Oracle subsidiary as of 2005) and Navision started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.\nCustomer relationship management was popularized in 1997 due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities. Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted customer base was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle), Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.\nThe first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to the cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction. Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favourite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell. The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions. In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business. In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it \"identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors\".\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Strategic ===\nStrategic CRM concentrates upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.\nThe focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV.\n\n\n=== Operational ===\nThe primary goal of CRM systems is integration and automation of sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of three main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.\n\nSales force automation works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client. It implements sales promotion analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.\nMarketing automation focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on customer engagement through social media.\nService automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.\n\n\n=== Analytical ===\nThe role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions. Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently. For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After reviewing their data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.\n\n\n=== Collaborative ===\nThe third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organizations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.\n\n\n=== Customer data platform ===\n\nA customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.  As of February 2017, about twenty companies were selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\nThe main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of the value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of their marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgment of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. By studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.\nRelational Intelligence, which is the awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm and the ability of the firm to reinforce or change those connections, is an important component of the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm's industrial view of customer relationships. A lack of relational intelligence is a sign that firms still see customers as resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than people looking for interesting and personalized interactions.\nCRM systems include:\n\nData warehouse technology, which is used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.\nOpportunity management, which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.\nCRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.\nSome CRM software is available as a software as a service (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.\nFor small businesses, a CRM system may consist of a contact management system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).\nCRM systems for eCommerce focus on marketing automation tasks such as cart rescue, re-engaging users with email, and personalization.\nCustomer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.\nSystems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.\nCRM not only indicates technology and strategy but also indicates an integrated approach that includes employees knowledge and organizational culture to embrace the CRM philosophy.\n\n\n== Effect on customer satisfaction ==\nCustomer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection. The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to affect customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.\nFirstly, firms can customize their offerings for each customer. By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers. This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because the perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts. For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction. CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.\n\n\n=== Customer benefits ===\nWith CRM systems, customers are served on the day-to-day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self-service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, then the customer satisfaction level is expected to increase. These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity, which are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.\n\nEnhanced ability to target profitable customers.\nIntegrated assistance across channels.\nEnhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness.\nImproved pricing.\nCustomized products and services.\nImproved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.\nIndividualized marketing messages are also called campaigns.\nConnect customers and all channels on a single platform.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\nResearch has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance. Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above the industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.\nAmazon has also seen successes through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.\n\n\n== Customer profile ==\n\nA customer profile is a detailed description of any particular classification of customer which is created to represent the typical users of a product or service. Customer profiling is a method to understand your customers in terms of demographics, behaviour and lifestyle. It is used to help make customer-focused decisions without confusing the scope of the project with personal opinion. Overall profiling is gathering information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.\nCustomer or consumer profiles are the essences of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. \nThe three basic methods of customer profiling are the psychographic approach, the consumer typology approach, and the consumer characteristics approach. These customer profiling methods help you design your business around who your customers are and help you make better customer-centered decisions.\n\n\n== Improving CRM ==\nConsultants hold that it is important for companies to establish strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence. According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars, and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate, or anything in between.\n\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nManagers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. \nCompanies must also improve the relational intelligence of their CRM systems. Companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more. Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence. Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customers' signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.\n\n\n=== Employee training ===\nMany firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and create strong customer-brand relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be trained to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.\n\n\n== In practice ==\n\n\n=== Call centers ===\nContact centre CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between the company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.\nGrowing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.\nGamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.\n\n\n=== Contact-center automation ===\nContact-center automation,  CCA, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question. Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.\n\n\n=== Social media ===\nSocial CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers. Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand. With the increase in the use of social media platforms, integrating CRM with the help of social media can potentially be a quicker and more cost-friendly process.\nSome CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.\nEnterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.\n\n\n=== Location-based services ===\nCRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.\n\n\n=== Business-to-business transactions ===\nDespite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.\nThe main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.\n\n\n== Market trends ==\n\n\n=== Social networking ===\nIn the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like \"system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites\" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.\nThe era of the \"social customer\" refers to the use of social media by customers.\n\n\n=== Mobile ===\nSome CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.\n\n\n=== Cloud computing and SaaS ===\nMany CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position. Over the years, the number of SaaS providers has grown with CRM being the leading category for 2024.\nTraditional providers moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011, and Taleo and Eloqua in 2012; SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011 and NetSuite acquired Verenia in 2022.\n\n\n=== Sales and sales force automation ===\nSales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM software. Some of the top CRM trends identified in 2021 include focusing on customer service automation such as chatbots, hyper-personalization based on customer data and insights, and the use of unified CRM systems. CRM vendors support sales productivity with different products, such as tools that measure the effectiveness of ads that appear in 3D video games.\nPharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.\n\n\n=== Vendor relationship management ===\nAnother related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of CRM Magazine.\n\n\n=== Customer success ===\nAnother trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for a more holistic understanding of customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space. As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites.\n\n\n=== AI and predictive analytics ===\nIn 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCompanies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably. They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients may be treated like an exchange party, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan. In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent. Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis. In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems. However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among developing countries' consumers.\nCollection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacy laws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.\nPart of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company. The CRM paradox, also referred to as the \"dark side of CRM\", may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers. This can happen because a business prioritizes customers who are more profitable, more relationship-orientated or tend to have increased loyalty to the company. Although focusing on such customers by itself is not a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.\nCRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communication with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n Business portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Customer satisfaction is a term frequently used in marketing to evaluate customer experience. It is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. Customer satisfaction is defined as \"the number of customers, or percentage of total customers, whose reported experience with a firm, its products, or its services (ratings) exceeds specified satisfaction goals\". Enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering customer loyalty are pivotal for businesses, given the significant importance of improving the balance between customer attitudes before and after the consumption process.\nExpectancy disconfirmation theory is the most widely accepted theoretical framework for explaining customer satisfaction. However, other frameworks, such as equity theory, attribution theory, contrast theory, assimilation theory, and various others, are also used to gain insights into customer satisfaction. However, traditionally applied satisfaction surveys are influence by biases related to social desirability, availability heuristics, memory limitations, respondents' mood while answering questions, as well as affective, unconscious, and dynamic nature of customer experience. \nThe Marketing Accountability Standards Board endorses the definitions, purposes, and measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project. In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 71 percent responded that they found a customer satisfaction metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses. Customer satisfaction is viewed as a key performance indicator within business and is often part of a balanced scorecard. In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a major differentiator and increasingly has become an important element of business strategy.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\n\nCustomer satisfaction operates in relation to both consumer and business usage of goods and services. Farris et al. wrote that \"[c]ustomer satisfaction provides a leading indicator of consumer purchase intentions and loyalty\".\nThe authors also wrote that \"customer satisfaction data are among the most frequently collected indicators of market perceptions. Their principal use is twofold:\" \n\n\"Within organizations, the collection, analysis and dissemination of these data send a message about the importance of tending to customers and ensuring that they have a positive experience with the company's goods and services.\"\n\"Although sales or market share can indicate how well a firm is performing currently, satisfaction is perhaps the best indicator of how likely it is that the firm’s customers will make further purchases in the future. Much research has focused on the relationship between customer satisfaction and retention. Studies indicate that the ramifications of satisfaction are most strongly realized at the extremes.\"\nOn a five-point scale, \"individuals who rate their satisfaction level as '5' are likely to become return customers and might even evangelize for the firm. A second important metric related to satisfaction is willingness to recommend. This metric is defined as \"[t]he percentage of surveyed customers who indicate that they would recommend a brand to friends\". A previous study about customer satisfaction stated that when a customer is satisfied with a product, he or she might recommend it to friends, relatives and colleagues. This can be a powerful marketing advantage. According to Farris et al., \"[i]ndividuals who rate their satisfaction level as '1,' by contrast, are unlikely to return. Further, they can hurt the firm by making negative comments about it to prospective customers. Willingness to recommend is a key metric relating to customer satisfaction.\"\nIn a business context where purchasing decisions involve a number of different individuals with varying objectives and professional backgrounds, Jagdish Sheth noted that varying degrees of satisfaction with previous usage of a product or a supplier are one of the reasons why business decisions can become challenging when a consensus on a purchasing decision is required.\n\n\n== Theoretical ground ==\nIn the research literature, the antecedents of customer satisfaction are studied from different perspectives. These perspectives extend from the psychological to the physical as well as from the normative perspective. However, in much of the literature, research has been focused on two basic constructs, (a) expectations prior to purchase or use of a product and (b) customer perception of the performance of that product after using it.\nA customer's expectations about a product bear on how the customer thinks the product will perform. Consumers are thought to have various \"types\" of expectations when forming opinions about a product's anticipated performance. Miller (1977) described four types of expectations: ideal, expected, minimum tolerable, and desirable. Day (1977) underlined different types of expectations, including ones about costs, the nature of the product, benefits, and social value. \nIt is considered that customers judge products on a limited set of norms and attributes. Olshavsky and Miller (1972) and Olson and Dover (1976) designed their researches as to manipulate actual product performance, and their aim was to find out how perceived performance ratings were influenced by expectations. These studies took out the discussions about explaining the differences between expectations and perceived performance.\"\nIn some research studies, scholars have been able to establish that customer satisfaction has a strong emotional, i.e., affective, component. Still others show that the cognitive and affective components of customer satisfaction reciprocally influence each other over time to determine overall satisfaction.\nEspecially for durable goods that are consumed over time, there is value to taking a dynamic perspective on customer satisfaction. Within a dynamic perspective, customer satisfaction can evolve over time as customers repeatedly use a product or interact with a service. The satisfaction experienced with each interaction (transactional satisfaction) can influence the overall, cumulative satisfaction. Scholars showed that it is not just overall customer satisfaction, but also customer loyalty that evolves over time.\n\n\n=== The disconfirmation model ===\n\"The Disconfirmation Model is based on the comparison of customers’ [expectations] and their [perceived performance] ratings. Specifically, an individual’s expectations are confirmed when a product performs as expected. It is negatively confirmed when a product performs more poorly than expected. The disconfirmation is positive when a product performs over the expectations (Churchill & Suprenant 1982).\nThere are four constructs to describe the traditional disconfirmation paradigm mentioned as expectations, performance, disconfirmation and satisfaction.\"\n\"Satisfaction is considered as an outcome of purchase and use, resulting from the buyers’ comparison of expected rewards and incurred costs of the purchase in relation to the anticipated consequences. In operation, satisfaction is somehow similar to attitude as it can be evaluated as the sum of satisfactions with some features of a product.\"\n\"In the literature, cognitive and affective models of satisfaction are also developed and considered as alternatives (Pfaff, 1977).\nChurchill and Suprenant in 1982, evaluated various studies in the literature and formed an overview of Disconfirmation process in the following figure:\" \n\n\n== Construction ==\n\nOrganizations need to retain existing customers while targeting non-customers. Measuring customer satisfaction provides an indication of how successful the organization is at providing products or services to the marketplace.\n\"Customer satisfaction is measured at the individual level, but it is almost always reported at an aggregate level. It can be, and often is, measured along various dimensions. A hotel, for example, might ask customers to rate their experience with its front desk and check-in service, with the room, with the amenities in the room, with the restaurants, and so on. Additionally, in a holistic sense, the hotel might ask about overall satisfaction 'with your stay.'\"\nAs research on consumption experiences grows, evidence suggests that consumers purchase goods and services for a combination of two types of benefits: hedonic and utilitarian. Hedonic benefits are associated with the sensory and experiential attributes of the product. Utilitarian benefits of a product are associated with the more instrumental and functional attributes of the product (Batra and Athola 1990).\nCustomer satisfaction is an ambiguous and abstract concept and the actual manifestation of the state of satisfaction will vary from person to person and product/service to product/service. The state of satisfaction depends on a number of both psychological and physical variables which correlate with satisfaction behaviors such as return and recommend rate. The level of satisfaction can also vary depending on other options the customer may have and other products against which the customer can compare the organization's products.\nWork done by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry (Leonard L) between 1985 and 1988 provides the basis for the measurement of customer satisfaction with a service by using the gap between the customer's expectation of performance and their perceived experience of performance. This provides the measurer with a satisfaction \"gap\" which is objective and quantitative in nature. Work done by Cronin and Taylor propose the \"confirmation/disconfirmation\" theory of combining the \"gap\" described by Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry as two different measures (perception and expectation of performance) into a single measurement of performance according to expectation.\nThe usual measures of customer satisfaction involve a survey using a Likert scale. The customer is asked to evaluate each statement in terms of their perceptions and expectations of performance of the organization being measured.\nGood quality measures need to have high satisfaction loading, good reliability, and low error variances. In an empirical study comparing commonly used satisfaction measures it was found that two multi-item semantic differential scales performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian service consumption contexts. A study by Wirtz & Lee (2003), found that a six-item 7-point semantic differential scale (for example, Oliver and Swan 1983), which is a six-item 7-point bipolar scale, consistently performed best across both hedonic and utilitarian services. It loaded most highly on satisfaction, had the highest item reliability, and had by far the lowest error variance across both studies. In the study, the six items asked respondents’ evaluation of their most recent experience with ATM services and ice cream restaurant, along seven points within these six items: “pleased me to displeased me”, “contented with to disgusted with”, “very satisfied with to very dissatisfied with”, “did a good job for me to did a poor job for me”, “wise choice to poor choice” and “happy with to unhappy with”. A semantic differential (4 items) scale (e.g., Eroglu and Machleit 1990), which is a four-item 7-point bipolar scale, was the second best performing measure, which was again consistent across both contexts. In the study, respondents were asked to evaluate their experience with both products, along seven points within these four items: “satisfied to dissatisfied”, “favorable to unfavorable”, “pleasant to unpleasant” and “I like it very much to I didn’t like it at all”. The third best scale was single-item percentage measure, a one-item 7-point bipolar scale (e.g., Westbrook 1980). Again, the respondents were asked to evaluate their experience on both ATM services and ice cream restaurants, along seven points within “delighted to terrible”.\nFinally, all measures captured both affective and cognitive aspects of satisfaction, independent of their scale anchors. Affective measures capture a consumer’s attitude (liking/disliking) towards a product, which can result from any product information or experience. On the other hand, cognitive element is defined as an appraisal or conclusion on how the product’s performance compared against expectations (or exceeded or fell short of expectations), was useful (or not useful), fit the situation (or did not fit), exceeded the requirements of the situation (or did not exceed).\n\nRecent research shows that in most commercial applications, such as firms conducting customer surveys, a single-item overall satisfaction scale performs just as well as a multi-item scale. Especially in larger scale studies where a researcher needs to gather data from a large number of customers, a single-item scale may be preferred because it can reduce total survey error.  An interesting recent finding from re-interviewing the same clients of a firm is that only 50% of respondents give the same satisfaction rating when re-interviewed, even when there has been no service encounter between the client and firm between surveys.  The study found a 'regression to the mean' effect in customer satisfaction responses, whereby the respondent group who gave unduly low scores in the first survey regressed up toward the mean level in the second, while the group who gave unduly high scores tended to regress downward toward the overall mean level in the second survey.\n\n\n== Methodologies ==\nThe American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) is a scientific standard of customer satisfaction. Academic research has shown that the national ACSI score is a strong predictor of gross domestic product (GDP) growth, and an even stronger predictor of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) growth. On the microeconomic level, academic studies have shown that ACSI data is related to a firm's financial performance in terms of return on investment (ROI), sales, long-term firm value (Tobin's q), cash flow, cash flow volatility, human capital performance, portfolio returns, debt financing, risk, and consumer spending. Increasing ACSI scores have been shown to predict loyalty, word-of-mouth recommendations, and purchase behavior. The ACSI measures customer satisfaction annually for more than 200 companies in 43 industries and 10 economic sectors. In addition to quarterly reports, the ACSI methodology can be applied to private sector companies and government agencies in order to improve loyalty and purchase intent.\nThe Kano model is a theory of product development and customer satisfaction developed in the 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano that classifies customer preferences into five categories: Attractive, One-Dimensional, Must-Be, Indifferent, Reverse. The Kano model offers some insight into the product attributes which are perceived to be important to customers.\nSERVQUAL or RATER is a service-quality framework that has been incorporated into customer-satisfaction surveys (e.g., the revised Norwegian Customer Satisfaction Barometer) to indicate the gap between customer expectations and experience.\nJ.D. Power and Associates provides another measure of customer satisfaction, known for its top-box approach and automotive industry rankings. J.D. Power and Associates' marketing research consists primarily of consumer surveys and is publicly known for the value of its product awards.\nOther research and consulting firms have customer satisfaction solutions as well. These include A.T. Kearney's Customer Satisfaction Audit process, which incorporates the Stages of Excellence framework and which helps define a company’s status against eight critically identified dimensions.\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is also used to measure customer satisfaction. On a scale of 0 to 10, this score measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company to others. Despite many points of criticism from a scientific point of view, the NPS is widely used in practice. Its popularity and broad use have been attributed to its simplicity and its openly available methodology.\nFor B2B customer satisfaction surveys, where there is a small customer base, a high response rate to the survey is desirable. The American Customer Satisfaction Index (2012) found that response rates for paper-based surveys were around 10% and the response rates for e-surveys (web, wap and e-mail) were averaging between 5% and 15% - which can only provide a straw poll of the customers' opinions.\nIn the European Union member states, many methods for measuring impact and satisfaction of e-government services are in use, which the eGovMoNet project sought to compare and harmonize.\nThese customer satisfaction methodologies have not been independently audited by the Marketing Accountability Standards Board according to MMAP (marketing metric audit protocol).\nThere are many operational strategies for improving customer satisfaction but at the most fundamental level you need to understand customer expectations.\nRecently there has been a growing interest in predicting customer satisfaction using big data and machine learning methods (with behavioral and demographic features as predictors) to take targeted preventive actions aimed at avoiding churn, complaints and dissatisfaction.\n\n\n== Prevalence ==\nA 2008 survey found that only 3.5% of Chinese consumers were satisfied with their online shopping experience. A 2020 Arizona State University survey found that customer satisfaction in the United States is deteriorating. Roughly two-thirds of survey participants reported feeling \"rage\" over their experiences as consumers. A multi-decade decline in consumer satisfaction since the 1970s was observed. A majority of respondents felt that their customer service complaints were not sufficiently addressed by businesses. A 2022 report found that consumer experiences in the United States had declined substantially in the 2 years since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the United Kingdom in 2022, customer service complaints were at record highs, owing to staffing shortages and the supply crisis related to the COVID pandemic.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer experience\nBusiness case\nComputer user satisfaction\nCustomer satisfaction research\nCustomer service\nCustomer Loyalty\nThe International Customer Service Institute\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCustomer Satisfaction: A Central Phenomenon in Marketing",

        "content": "Technical support, commonly shortened as tech support, is a form of customer service provided to assist users in resolving problems with products such as consumer electronics and software. Technical support is typically delivered through call centers, online chat, and email services. In addition, many companies operate online forums or discussion boards where customers can provide peer-to-peer assistance, a practice shown to reduce the workload and costs of formal support channels.\n\n\n== Outsourcing tech support ==\nWith the increasing use of technology in modern times, there is a growing requirement to provide technical support. Many organizations locate their technical support departments or call centers in countries or regions with lower costs. Dell outsourced its technical support and customer service operations to India in 2001; some of these jobs were later moved back to the United States. There has also been a growth in companies specializing in providing technical support to other organizations, often referred to as Managed Service Providers (MSPs).\nFor businesses needing to provide technical support, outsourcing allows them to maintain high availability of service, especially during peak demand or product launches. Such arrangements may reduce operational costs and enable core employees to focus on primary responsibilities. It also provides access to specialized personnel with technical expertise beyond the internal workforce.\n\n\n== Multi-level tech support ==\nTechnical support is often subdivided into tiers, or levels, in order to better serve a business or customer base. The number of levels a business uses to organize their technical support group is dependent on the business's needs regarding their ability to sufficiently serve their customers or users. The purpose of a multi-tiered support system is to improve efficiency by matching issue complexity with technician expertise. Success of the organizational structure is dependent on the technicians' understanding of their level of responsibility and commitments, their customer response time commitments, and when to appropriately escalate an issue and to which level. A common support structure revolves around a three-tiered technical support system. Remote computer repair is a method for troubleshooting software related problems via remote desktop connections.  \n\n\n=== L1 Support ===\nTier I (or Level 1, abbreviated as T1 or L1) is the first technical support level. The first job of a Tier I specialist is to gather the customer's information and to determine the customer's issue by analyzing the symptoms and figuring out the underlying problem. When analyzing the symptoms, it is important for the technician to identify what the customer is trying to accomplish so that time is not wasted on \"attempting to solve a symptom instead of a problem.\"\nOnce identification of the underlying problem is established, the specialist can begin sorting through the possible solutions available. Technical support specialists in this group typically handle straightforward and simple problems while \"possibly using some kind of knowledge management tool.\" This includes troubleshooting methods such as verifying physical layer issues, resolving username and password problems, uninstalling/reinstalling basic software applications, verification of proper hardware and software set up, and assistance with navigating around application menus. Personnel at this level have a basic to general understanding of the product or service and may not always have the expertise for complex issues. They are expected to resolve most straightforward problems, typically 70–80% of reported cases.\n\n\n=== L2 Support ===\nTier II (or Level 2, abbreviated as T2 or L2) is a more in-depth technical support level than Tier I and therefore costs more as the technicians are more experienced and knowledgeable on a particular product or service. It is synonymous with level 2 support, support line 2, administrative level support, and various other headings denoting advanced technical troubleshooting and analysis methods. Technicians in this realm of knowledge are responsible for assisting Tier I personnel in solving basic technical problems and for investigating elevated issues by confirming the validity of the problem and seeking for known solutions related to these more complex issues. However, prior to the troubleshooting process, it is important that the technician review the work order to see what has already been accomplished by the Tier I technician and how long the technician has been working with the particular customer. This is a key element in meeting both the customer and business needs as it allows the technician to prioritize the troubleshooting process and properly manage their time.\nIf a problem is new and/or personnel from this group cannot determine a solution, they are responsible for elevating this issue to the Tier III technical support group. In addition, many companies may specify that certain troubleshooting solutions be performed by this group to help ensure the intricacies of a challenging issue are solved by providing experienced and knowledgeable technicians. This may include, but is not limited to, onsite installations or replacement of various hardware components, software repair, diagnostic testing, or the utilization of remote control tools to take over the user's machine for the sole purpose of troubleshooting and finding a solution to the problem.\n\n\n=== L3 Support ===\nTier III (or Level 3, abbreviated as T3 or L3) is the highest level of support in a three-tiered technical support model responsible for handling the most difficult or advanced problems. It is synonymous with level 3 support, 3rd line support, back-end support, support line 3, high-end support, and various other headings denoting expert level troubleshooting and analysis methods. These individuals are subject-matter experts who support both Tier I and II personnel and contribute to developing solutions for new or previously unresolved issues. Note that Tier III technicians have the same responsibility as Tier II technicians in reviewing the work order and assessing the time already spent with the customer so that the work is prioritized and time management is sufficiently utilized. If it is at all possible, the technician will work to solve the problem with the customer as it may become apparent that the Tier I and/or Tier II technicians simply failed to discover the proper solution. Upon encountering new problems, however, Tier III personnel must first determine whether or not to solve the problem and may require the customer's contact information so that the technician can have adequate time to troubleshoot the issue and find a solution. It is typical for a developer or someone who knows the code or backend of the product, to be the Tier 3 support person.\nIn some instances, an issue may be so problematic to the point where the product cannot be salvaged and must be replaced. Such extreme problems are also sent to the original developers for in-depth analysis. If it is determined that a problem can be solved, this group is responsible for designing and developing one or more courses of action, evaluating each of these courses in a test case environment, and implementing the best solution to the problem.\n\n\n=== L4 Support ===\nWhile not universally used, a fourth level often represents an escalation point beyond the organization. L4 support is generally a hardware or software vendor.\n\n\n== Scams ==\n\nA common scam typically involves a cold caller claiming to be from a technical support department of a company like Microsoft. These scams have often originated from call centers in various countries targeting users in English-speaking regions, though increasingly they also operate domestically. The scammer will instruct the user to download a remote desktop program and once connected, use social engineering techniques that typically involve Windows components to persuade the victim that they need to pay in order for the computer to be fixed and then proceeds to steal money from the victim's credit card.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCall center\nCall board\nCustomer service\nComparison of issue-tracking systems\nComparison of help desk issue tracking software\nHelp desk\nHelp desk software\nCustomer support\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A technical support scam, or tech support scam, is a type of scam in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate technical support service. Victims contact scammers in a variety of ways, often through fake pop-ups resembling error messages or via fake \"help lines\" advertised on websites owned by the scammers. Technical support scammers use social engineering and a variety of confidence tricks to persuade their victim of the presence of problems on their computer or mobile device, such as a malware infection, when there are no issues with the victim's device. The scammer will then persuade the victim to pay to fix the fictitious \"problems\" that they claim to have found. Payment is made to the scammer via gift cards or cryptocurrency, which are hard to trace and have few consumer protections in place.\nTechnical support scams have occurred as early as 2008. A 2017 study of technical support scams found that of the IPs that could be geolocated, 85% could be traced to locations in India, 7% to locations in the United States and 3% to locations in Costa Rica.  Research into tech support scams suggests that Millennials and Gen Z have the highest exposure to such scams; however, senior citizens are more likely to fall for these scams and lose money to them. Technical support scams were named by Norton as the top phishing threat to consumers in October 2021; Microsoft found that 60% of consumers who took part in a survey had been exposed to a technical support scam within the previous twelve months. Responses to technical support scams include lawsuits brought against companies responsible for running fraudulent call centres and scam baiting.\n\n\n== Origin and distribution ==\nThe first tech support scams were recorded in 2008. Technical support scams have been seen in a variety of countries, including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, The Netherlands, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa.\nA 2017 study of technical support scams published at the NDSS Symposium found that, of the tech support scams in which the IPs involved could be geolocated, 85% could be traced to locations in India, 7% to locations in the United States and 3% to locations in Costa Rica. India has millions of English speakers who are competing for relatively few jobs. One municipality had 114 jobs and received 19,000 applicants. This high level of unemployment serves as an incentive for tech scamming jobs, which are often well-paid. Additionally, scammers exploit the levels of unemployment by offering jobs to people desperate to be employed. Many scammers do not realise they are applying and being trained for tech support scam jobs, but many decide to stay after finding out the nature of their job as they feel it is too late to back out of the job and change careers.  Scammers are forced to choose between keeping their job or becoming jobless. Some scammers convince themselves that they are targeting wealthy people that have money to spare, which justifies their theft, whilst others see their job as generating \"easy money\". Some scammers rationalize that the victim needs an anti-virus anyway and therefore, it is acceptable to tell the victim lies and charge them for technical support or to charge them for an anti-virus.\n\n\n== Operation ==\nTechnical support scams rely on social engineering to persuade victims that their device is infected with malware. Scammers use a variety of confidence tricks to persuade the victim to install remote desktop software, with which the scammer can then take control of the victim's computer. With this access, the scammer may then launch various Windows components and utilities (such as the Event Viewer), install third-party utilities (such as rogue security software) and perform other tasks in an effort to convince the victim that the computer has critical problems that must be remediated, such as infection with a virus. Scammers target a variety of people, though research by Microsoft suggests that millennials (defined by Microsoft as age 24-37) and people part of generation Z (age 18-23) have the highest exposure to tech support scams and the Federal Trade Commission has found that seniors (age 60 and over) are more likely to lose money to tech support scams. The scammer will urge the victim to pay so the \"issues\" can be fixed.\n\n\n=== Initiation ===\n\nTechnical support scams can begin in a variety of ways. Some variants of the scam are initiated using pop-up advertising on infected websites or via cybersquatting of major websites. The victim is shown pop-ups which resemble legitimate error messages such as a Blue Screen of Death and freeze the victim's web browser. The pop-up instructs the victim to call the scammers via a phone number to \"fix the error\". Technical support scams can also be initiated via cold calls. These are usually robocalls which claim to be associated with a legitimate third party such as Apple Inc. Technical support scams can also attract victims by purchasing keyword advertising on major search engines for phrases such as \"Microsoft support\". Victims who click on these adverts are taken to web pages containing the scammer's phone numbers. In some cases, mass emailing is used. The email tends to state that a certain product has been purchased using their Amazon account and contact a certain telephone number if this is an error.\n\n\n=== Confidence tricks ===\nOnce a victim has contacted a scammer, the scammer will usually instruct them to download and install a remote access program such as TeamViewer, AnyDesk, LogMeIn or GoToAssist. The scammer convinces the victim to provide them with the credentials required to initiate a remote-control session, giving the scammer complete control of the victim's desktop. The scammer will not tell the victim that he is using a remote control software and that the purpose is to gain access to the victim’s PC. The scammer will say \"this is for connecting you to our secure server\" or \"I am going to give you a secure code\" which in reality is just an ID number used by the remote desktop software package.\nAfter gaining access, the scammer attempts to convince the victim that the computer is suffering from problems that must be repaired. They will use several methods to misrepresent the content and significance of common Windows tools and system directories as evidence of malicious activity, such as viruses and other malware. These tricks are meant to target victims who may be unfamiliar with the actual uses of these tools, such as inexperienced users and senior citizens. The scammer then coaxes the victim into paying for the scammer's services and/or software, which they claim is designed to \"repair\" or \"clean\" the computer but is either malicious or simply does nothing at all.\n\nThe scammer may open Windows' Event Viewer, which displays a logfile of various events for use by system administrators to troubleshoot problems. Although many of the log entries are relatively harmless notifications, the scammer may claim that the log entries labeled as warnings and errors are evidence of \"system corruption\" that must be \"fixed\" for a fee.\nThe scammer may show system folders that contain unusually named files to the victim, such as those in Windows' Prefetch and Temp folders, and claim that the files are evidence of malware on the victim's computer. The scammer may also open some of these files in Notepad, wherein binary file contents are rendered as mojibake. The scammer claims that malware has corrupted these files, causing the unintelligible output. In reality, the files in Prefetch are typically harmless, intact binary files used to speed up certain operations.\nThe scammer may falsely claim that normally disabled Windows services should not be disabled and that these services were disabled due to a computer virus.\nThe scammer may misuse Command Prompt tools to generate suspicious-looking output, for instance using the tree or dir /s command which displays an extensive listing of files and directories. The scammer may claim that they are \"searching for malware and hackers\", and while the tool is running the scammer will enter text purporting to be an error message (such as \"ECHO security breach ... trojans found\") that will appear when the job finishes, or will open a text file with such claims in Notepad or Word.\nThe scammer may misrepresent innocuous values and keys that are stored in the Windows Registry as being signs of malware.\nThe \"Send To\" Windows function is associated with a globally unique identifier. The output of the command assoc, which lists all file associations on the system, displays this association with the line ZFSendToTarget=CLSID\\{888DCA60-FC0A-11CF-8F0F-00C04FD7D062}; this GUID is the same on all recent versions of Windows. The scammer may claim that this is a unique ID used to identify the user's computer, before reading out the identifier to \"verify\" that they are a legitimate support company with information on the victim's computer, or claim that the CLSID listed is actually a \"Computer Licence Security ID\" that must be renewed.\nThe scammer may claim that the alleged \"problems\" are the result of expired hardware or software warranties and then coax the victim into paying for a nonsensical and fraudulent \"renewal service\".\nThe scammer may block the victim from viewing their screen, claiming that it is the result of malware or of a scan being run, and use this time to search the victim's files for sensitive information, attempt to break into the victim's bank account with stolen or found credentials or activate the webcam and see the victim's face.\nThe scammer may run the command line tool known as netstat, which shows local and foreign IP addresses. The scammer then tells the victim that these addresses belong to foreign hackers that have gained access to their network.\nThe scammer may claim that legitimate Windows process such as rundll32.exe are viruses. Often, the scammer will search Google or Yahoo for an article about RUNDLL32.EXE and will scroll to a section saying that the process name can also possibly be part of a malware infection, even though the victim's computer does not contain malware.\n\n\n=== Payment and impact ===\nThe preferred method of payment in a technical support scam is via gift cards. Gift cards are favoured by scammers because they are readily available to buy and have less consumer protections in place that could allow the victim to reclaim their money back. Additionally, the usage of gift cards as payment allows the scammers to extract money quickly whilst remaining anonymous. Tech support scammers have also been known to ask for payment in the form of cryptocurrency, cheques and direct bank transfers made through automated clearing house (the latter only gives victims 60 days to recover their funds).\nIf a victim refuses to follow the scammer's instructions or to pay them, scammers have been known to resort to insulting and threatening their victim to procure payment. Scammers may also resort to bullying, coercion, threats and other forms of intimidation and psychological abuse towards their target in an effort to undermine the victim's ability to think clearly, making them more likely to be forced further into the scam. Crimes threatened to be inflicted on victims or their families by scammers have ranged from theft, fraud and extortion, to serious crimes such as rape and murder. Canadian citizen Jakob Dulisse reported to CBC in 2019 that, upon asking a scammer who made contact with him as to why he had been targeted, the scammer responded with a death threat; 'Anglo people who travel to the country' (India) were 'cut up in little pieces and thrown in the river.' Scammers have also been known to lock uncooperative victims out of their computer using the syskey utility (present only in Windows versions previous to Windows 10) or third party applications which they install on the victim's computer, and to delete documents and/or programs essential to the operation of the victim's computer if they do not receive payment. On Windows 10 and 11, since Microsoft removed the syskey utility, scammers will change the user’s account password. The scammer will open the Control Panel, go into user settings and click on change password, and the scammer will ask the user to type in his password in the old password field. The scammer will then create a password that only he knows and will reboot the computer. The user won’t be able to log into his PC unless he pays the scammer.\nMicrosoft commissioned a survey by YouGov across 16 countries in July 2021 to research tech support scams and their impact on consumers. The survey found that approximately 60% of consumers who participated had been exposed to a technical support scam within the last 12 months. Victims reported losing an average of 200 USD to the scammers and many faced repeated interactions from other scammers once they had been successfully scammed. Norton named technical support scams as the top phishing threat to consumers in October 2021, having blocked over 12.3 million tech support scam URLs between July and September 2021.\n\n\n== Response ==\nLegal action has been taken against some companies carrying out technical support scams. In December 2014, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against a California-based company operating such scams for \"misusing Microsoft's name and trademarks\" and \"creating security issues for victims by gaining access to their computers and installing malicious software, including a password grabber that could provide access to personal and financial information\". In December 2015, the state of Washington sued the firm iYogi for scamming consumers and making false claims in order to scare the users into buying iYogi's diagnostic software. iYogi was also accused of falsely claiming that they were affiliated with Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Apple.\nIn September 2011, Microsoft dropped gold partner Comantra from its Microsoft Partner Network following accusations of involvement in cold-call technical-support scams. However, the ease with which companies that carry out technical support scams can be launched makes it difficult to prevent tech support scams from taking place.\nMajor search engines such as Bing and Google have taken steps to restrict the promotion of fake technical support websites through keyword advertising. Microsoft-owned advertising network Bing Ads (which services ad sales on Bing and Yahoo! Search engines) amended its terms of service in May 2016 to prohibit the advertising of third-party technical support services or ads claiming to \"provide a service that can only be provided by the actual owner of the products or service advertised\". Google announced a verification program in 2018 in an attempt to restrict advertising for third-party tech support to legitimate companies.\n\n\n=== Scam baiting ===\n\nTech support scammers are regularly targeted by scam baiting, with individuals seeking to raise awareness of these scams by uploading recordings on platforms like YouTube, cause scammers inconvenience by wasting their time and protect potential victims. A good example of this is the YouTube community Scammer Payback.\nAdvanced scam baiters may infiltrate the scammer's computer, and potentially disable it by deploying remote access trojans, distributed denial of service attacks and destructive malware. Scam baiters may also attempt to lure scammers into exposing their unethical practices by leaving dummy files or malware disguised as confidential information such as credit/debit card information and passwords on a virtual machine, which the scammer may attempt to steal, only to become infected. Sensitive information important to carrying out further investigations by a law enforcement agency may be retrieved, and additional information on the rogue firm may then be posted or compiled online to warn potential victims.\nIn March 2020, an anonymous YouTuber under the alias Jim Browning successfully infiltrated and gathered drone and CCTV footage of a fraudulent call centre scam operation through the help of fellow YouTube personality Karl Rock. Through the aid of the British documentary programme Panorama, a police raid was carried out when the documentary was brought to the attention of assistant police commissioner Karan Goel, leading to the arrest of call centre operator Amit Chauhan who also operated a fraudulent travel agency under the name \"Faremart Travels\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nAdvance-fee scam\nAntivirus software\nCybercrime in India\nIRS impersonation scam\nSSA impersonation scam\nTelemarketing fraud\nVirus hoax\nList of scams\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Global Tech Support Scam Research – Global Summary\" (PDF).

        "content": "Technical Support Division (TSD) was a hypothetical \nad hoc Indian Army Military Intelligence unit formed in 2010 under the then Chief of Army Staff General V K Singh. After the functioning of the TSD was questioned for falling prey to politics, including politics between the three military chiefs, among other things, it was disbanded in 2012 following the retirement of General V K Singh after all officers assigned to the division were transferred out and nobody new replaced them.\n\n\n== Creation ==\nThe need and trigger for the formation of a new military intelligence unit was felt following 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks. After this, National Security Adviser, M.K Narayanan, tried to find out if Indian intelligence and security agencies had the capability to attack terror groups in Pakistan. After finding out that no agency had this capability, he asked them to raise a team. However it was only in March 2010, when Lt Gen R.K. Loomba, chief of Military Intelligence, approached General V.K. Singh with the proposal. General V.K. Singh gave the go ahead, and accordingly Lt Gen R.K. Loomba put Colonel Hunny Bakshi to be in charge of the new unit and train them.\n\n\n=== Mandate ===\nThe TSD's primary internal focus was to be in the North and North-East regions of India, as well as \"inside depth areas of countries of interest.\" It was allegedly tasked with planning and executing special operations both domestically and internationally that \"counter enemy efforts within the country by effective covert means\". Internal army approvals were granted as this would allow the Military Intelligence Directorate to quickly respond to state-sponsored terrorism with a \"high degree of deniability.\" The TSD was also asked to cover any tracks leading to it.\nAnother focus of the TSD was the targeting of high-level terrorists deep in enemy territory as well as conducting psychological warfare.\nThe TSD had no official jurisdiction or mandate, which led to conflicts with other intelligence and counter-terrorism agencies. Formation commanders found TSD conducting operations in border areas without their knowledge and at least one general complained about the TSD's activities in Kashmir to General V.K Singh, the then Chief of Army Staff. There were also questions about its legality as intelligence gathering and covert operations beyond Indian borders falls to civilian agencies such as the Research and Analysis Wing.\n\n\n=== Structure and logistics ===\nTSD fulfilled no government requirements and was an ad hoc unit with no official sanction or war establishment authorization. This meant no soldier could be attached to the unit, and hence were attached to military intelligence unit 25. However, they did not report to the Brigadier in-charge of MI-25 and reported directly to the Chief of Army Staff. The unit began with either four officers and thirty two men or six officers, five JCOs and 30 men, according to different accounts. The TSD was approved in writing through an operational directive by then Defense Minister, A.K Antony.\nThese men were picked by Colonel Hunny Bakshi. The officers selected included:\n\nLt Col Birdie, a former R&AW operative who received a gallantry award.\nLt Col Sarvesh, a Kargil veteran and skydiver with over 3000 jumps.\nLt Col Alfred, a negotiator who helped form a truce between the ULFA and the Indian army.\nLt Col Zir, an intelligence operative known for having a large network and bringing about a ceasefire with the DHD.\nLt Col Naughty, an expert in cultivating assets who was credited for identifying the people behind stone pelting incidents in Kashmir.\nAn unnamed officer who was senior to Bakshi and was close to retirement.\nTSD allegedly operated out of a two-storied building in the Delhi cantonment, nicknamed the Butchery, as it was a slaughterhouse in the colonial era.\n\n\n=== Budget ===\nTSD received secret service funds that were drawn from accounts in the State Bank of India. According to then director general of military operations, Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia, the TSD was allocated a total of 20 crores for specific operations. These funds were reallocated from an annual 50 crore secret service fund belonging to field intelligence units operating near Indian borders.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nDue to the covert nature of the unit, not much is publicly known about their operations. Media leaks and reports by various agencies have led to some details being uncovered. Initial reports related to the team were positive, and missions were successful.\n\n\n=== Intelligence gathering ===\nTSD specialized in creating deep assets and surveillance. By the time they disbanded, the unit had created a large number of assets and contacts in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. TSD also tracked Syed Salahuddin, the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen chief, receiving praise for the same. A board of officers report also mentioned operations by the TSD in the Northeast.\n\n\n=== Covert operations ===\nTSD has allegedly conducted over 8 covert operations abroad. Details regarding these operations are sparse, but they include:\n\nOperation inside an Inter-Services Intelligence office in Faisalabad, Pakistan\nTurning a secessionist chief in a province of a neighboring country\nCarrying out \"eight low-intensity bomb blasts in a neighboring country\" \nWhen active, the TSD was also credited with stopping the flow of illegal arms to Naxals in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh from insurgents in the North-East and Myanmar. It has also been claimed that TSD was responsible for capturing two highly ranked terror group leaders and extracting them to India.\n\n\n== Alleged abuses of power ==\nAccording to defense journalist Ajit Kumar Dubey, the fight between General V.K Singh and the defense ministry over his age was viewed by General Bikram Singh and General Dalbir Singh Suhag as an attempt to scuttle their chances of succeeding him. This led to increased criticism of General V.K Singh's initiatives, the largest being TSD. This led to many allegations being leaked to the media. When General Bikram Singh became the COAS, a probe was ordered and the unit was disbanded. A CBI probe was also demanded, however this was overruled by A.K Antony, concerned about foreign reactions that may arise from further coverage of TSD's actions. Many DGMI officers still believe that TSD was simply caught in the middle of a political fight.\n\n\n=== Misuse of funds ===\nAfter General V.K Singh retired, director general of military operations, Lt Gen Vinod Bhatia conducted an inquiry into TSD. The inquiry found that 8 crore of the 20 crore used by the TSD were unaccounted for, however, the inquiry gave Colonel Bakshi the benefit of the doubt as the operations were covert and required an element of deniability. Media reports also alleged that there was frequent travel by TSD officials to Dubai and London using their personal passports, insinuating corruption, however nothing came of this.\n\n\n=== Surveillance in Delhi ===\nIn 2012, media reports alleged that TSD had spent 8 crores on off-air interception equipment that could be used to intercept mobile phone conversations. The Indian Express further claimed that this equipment had been deployed in the North Block to tap the phones of Defense Minister A.K. Antony and senior officials from the ministry. However, it was pointed out that A.K Antony uses an encrypted RAX line and not a regular service provider, making an off-air interception device useless. This allegation was never mentioned by the army or any internal inquiry and wasn't even used during the court martial of a TSD officer. General V.K Singh denied the allegations and called it 'gimmickry' for the upcoming elections.\n\n\n=== Attempts to influence domestic J&K politics ===\nFurther media reports soon emerged accusing General V.K Singh and the TSD of bribing Kashmiri politicians to destabilize the Omar Abdullah government. The media alleged that this was done by paying Rs 1.19 crore to Ghulam Hassan Mir, then J&K Agriculture Minister with the aim of toppling the J&K government. Critics questioned how a single independent MP could achieve this.\n\n\n=== Sabotaging Bikram Singh's appointment ===\nIt was further claimed that TSD paid Rs 2.38 crore given to Hakikat Singh, a man who set up an NGO called \"Kashmir Humanitarian Service Organisation\". This was linked to a previously unheard of NGO known as Yes Kashmir. This NGO was responsible for a public interest litigation against General Bikram Singh that alleged that the general received a gallantry medal for a fake encounter in 2001. The Army and General claimed that a Pakistani militant was killed in the encounter, whereas the family of the victim claimed he was a laborer. The Supreme Court dismissed the PIL and cleared the path for General Bikram Singh's promotion. Many viewed the PIL to be an attempt by the TSD and General V.K Singh to stop General Bikram Singh from becoming the COAS.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Officers ===\nAfter the first inquiry, several more were held, however no unlawful activities have been found. Unable to bring charges right after the disbandment, TSD officers were given punishment postings. Colonel Bakshi was posted to Ladakh as a quartermaster. Unable to cope with the hostility and harassment he faced from seniors, Bakshi admitted himself into the psychiatric ward of the Army Base Hospital in Delhi. His wife further wrote to the defense ministry and the prime minister, stating that he had suicidal tendencies.\nIn September 2015, the GOC Delhi Area recommended a court martial against three officers of the TSD. The trial started in August 2017 and ended in March 2018 when the GCM dropped all proceedings against Colonel Bakshi.\n\n\n=== Intelligence Agencies ===\nThe Deputy Chief of Army Staff, Lt General D.S. Thakur, when appearing as a witness in the case noted the following: “It is sad to see that the witch hunt against the Intelligence Corps Officers who put their careers and lives on the line and took grave risks in conducting these operations in the service of the nation, still continues. It is also sad that, we don’t realise what damage we have been doing to the overall morale and effectiveness of our Intelligence Corps. By pursuing such inquiries we are only sending message to our Intelligence Corps personnel not to take risks and play safe. It is our officers at the apex level who should squarely take the blame for this state of affairs as without vibrant Intelligence Corps operations, we will be blinded in the Army.” Regulations were also strengthened, the DGMI now needs to submit a quarterly statement of expenditure from secret service funds to the Defense Ministry. A new mandate has also been created, emphasizing that the DGMI can only engage in operations taking place on the Indian border.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A help desk is a department or person that provides assistance and information, usually for electronic or computer problems. In the mid-1990s, research by Iain Middleton of Robert Gordon University studied the value of an organization's help desks. It found that value was derived not only from a reactive response to user issues, but also from the help desk's unique position of communicating daily with numerous customers or employees. Information gained in areas such as technical problems, user preferences, and satisfaction can be valuable for the planning and development work of other information technology units.\nA main function of the help desk is to separate issues from defects. Many issues can be solved at the help desk level such as password resets and simple misunderstandings. Some issues will be the result of actual product defect which should be forwarded to a development team for resolution.\nLarge help desks have a person or team responsible for managing the incoming requests, called \"issues\"; they are commonly called queue managers or queue supervisors. The queue manager is responsible for the issue queues, which can be set up in various ways depending on the help desk size or structure. Typically, large help desks have several teams that are experienced in working on different issues. The queue manager will assign an issue to one of the specialized teams based on the type of issue raised. Some help desks may have telephone systems with ACD splits ensuring that calls about specific topics are put through to analysts with the requisite experience or knowledge.\n\n\n== See also ==\nService desk\nCall center\nCustomer service\nComparison of issue-tracking systems\nComparison of help desk issue tracking software\nTechnical support\nHelp desk software\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A virtual assistant (VA) is a software agent that can perform a range of tasks or services for a user based on user input such as commands or questions, including verbal ones. Such technologies often incorporate chatbot capabilities to streamline task execution. The interaction may be via text, graphical interface, or voice - as some virtual assistants are able to interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices.\nIn many cases, users can ask their virtual assistants questions, control home automation devices and media playback, and manage other basic tasks such as email, to-do lists, and calendars - all with verbal commands. In recent years, prominent virtual assistants for direct consumer use have included Apple Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant (Gemini), Microsoft copilot and Samsung Bixby. Also, companies in various industries often incorporate some kind of virtual assistant technology into their customer service or support.\nInto the 2020s, the emergence of artificial intelligence based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, has brought increased capability and interest to the field of virtual assistant products and services.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Experimental decades: 1910s–1980s ===\nRadio Rex was the first voice activated toy, patented in 1916 and released in 1922. It was a wooden toy in the shape of a dog that would come out of its house when its name is called.\nIn 1952, Bell Labs presented \"Audrey\", the Automatic Digit Recognition machine. It occupied a six-foot-high relay rack, consumed substantial power, had streams of cables and exhibited the myriad maintenance problems associated with complex vacuum-tube circuitry. It could recognize the fundamental units of speech, phonemes. It was limited to accurate recognition of digits spoken by designated talkers. It could therefore be used for voice dialing, but in most cases push-button dialing was cheaper and faster, rather than speaking the consecutive digits.\nAnother early tool which was enabled to perform digital speech recognition was the IBM Shoebox voice-activated calculator, presented to the general public during the 1962 Seattle World's Fair after its initial market launch in 1961. This early computer, developed almost 20 years before the introduction of the first IBM Personal Computer in 1981, was able to recognize 16 spoken words and the digits 0 to 9.\nThe first natural language processing computer program or the chatbot ELIZA was developed by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the 1960s. It was created to \"demonstrate that the communication between man and machine was superficial\". ELIZA used pattern matching and substitution methodology into scripted responses to simulate conversation, which gave an illusion of understanding on the part of the program.\nWeizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: \"I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.\nThis gave name to the ELIZA effect, the tendency to unconsciously assume computer behaviors are analogous to human behaviors; that is, anthropomorphisation, a phenomenon present in human interactions with virtual assistants.\nThe next milestone in the development of voice recognition technology was achieved in the 1970s at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with substantial support of the United States Department of Defense and its DARPA agency, funded five years of a Speech Understanding Research program, aiming to reach a minimum vocabulary of 1,000 words. Companies and academia including IBM, Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and Stanford Research Institute took part in the program.\nThe result was \"Harpy\", it mastered about 1000 words, the vocabulary of a three-year-old and it could understand sentences. It could process speech that followed pre-programmed vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar structures to determine which sequences of words made sense together, and thus reducing speech recognition errors.\nIn 1986, Tangora was an upgrade of the Shoebox, it was a voice recognizing typewriter. Named after the world's fastest typist at the time, it had a vocabulary of 20,000 words and used prediction to decide the most likely result based on what was said in the past. IBM's approach was based on a hidden Markov model, which adds statistics to digital signal processing techniques. The method makes it possible to predict the most likely phonemes to follow a given phoneme. Still each speaker had to individually train the typewriter to recognize his or her voice, and pause between each word.\nIn 1983, Gus Searcy invented the \"Butler In A Box\", an electronic voice home controller system.\n\n\n=== Birth of smart virtual assistants: 1990s–2010s ===\n\nIn the 1990s, digital speech recognition technology became a feature of the personal computer with IBM, Philips and Lernout & Hauspie fighting for customers. Much later the market launch of the first smartphone IBM Simon in 1994 laid the foundation for smart virtual assistants as we know them today.\nIn 1997, Dragon's Naturally Speaking software could recognize and transcribe natural human speech without pauses between each word into a document at a rate of 100 words per minute. A version of Naturally Speaking is still available for download and it is still used today, for instance, by many doctors in the US and the UK to document their medical records.\nIn 2001 Colloquis publicly launched  SmarterChild, on platforms like AIM and MSN Messenger. While entirely text-based SmarterChild was able to play games, check the weather, look up facts, and converse with users to an extent.\nThe first modern digital virtual assistant installed on a smartphone was Siri, which was introduced as a feature of the iPhone 4S on 4 October 2011. Apple Inc. developed Siri following the 2010 acquisition of Siri Inc., a spin-off of SRI International, which is a research institute financed by DARPA and the United States Department of Defense. Its aim was to aid in tasks such as sending a text message, making phone calls, checking the weather or setting up an alarm. Over time, it has developed to provide restaurant recommendations, search the internet, and provide driving directions.\nIn November 2014, Amazon announced Alexa alongside the Echo.In 2016, Salesforce debuted Einstein, developed from a set of technologies underlying the Salesforce platform. Einstein was replaced by Agentforce, an agentic AI, in September 2024.\nIn April 2017 Amazon released a service for building conversational interfaces for any type of virtual assistant or interface.\n\n\n=== Large Language Models: 2020s-present ===\n\nIn the 2020s, artificial intelligence (AI) systems like ChatGPT have gained popularity for their ability to generate human-like responses to text-based conversations. In February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which was then the \"largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters.\" On November 30, 2022, ChatGPT was launched as a prototype and quickly garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. The advent of ChatGPT and its introduction to the wider public increased interest and competition in the space. In February 2023, Google began introducing an experimental service called \"Bard\" which is based on its LaMDA program to generate text responses to questions asked based on information gathered from the web.\nWhile ChatGPT and other generalized chatbots based on the latest generative AI are capable of performing various tasks associated with virtual assistants, there are also more specialized forms of such technology that are designed to target more specific situations or needs.\n\n\n== Method of interaction ==\n\nVirtual assistants work via:\n\nText, including: online chat (especially in an instant messaging application or other application ), SMS text, e-mail or other text-based communication channel, for example Conversica's intelligent virtual assistants for business.\nVoice: for example with Amazon Alexa on Amazon Echo devices, Siri on an iPhone, Google Assistant on Google-enabled Android devices, or Bixby on Samsung devices.\nImages: some assistants, such as Google Assistant (which includes Google Lens) and Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy series, have the added capability of performing image processing to recognize objects in images.\nMany virtual assistants are accessible via multiple methods, offering versatility in how users can interact with them, whether through chat, voice commands, or other integrated technologies.\nVirtual assistants use natural language processing (NLP) to match user text or voice input to executable commands. Some continually learn using artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning and ambient intelligence. \nTo activate a virtual assistant using the voice, a wake word might be used. This is a word or groups of words such as \"Hey Siri\", \"OK Google\" or \"Hey Google\", \"Alexa\", and \"Hey Microsoft\". As virtual assistants become more popular, there are increasing legal risks involved.\n\n\n== Devices and objects ==\n\nVirtual assistants may be integrated into many types of platforms or, like Amazon Alexa, across several of them:\n\nInto devices like smart speakers such as Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod\nIn instant messaging applications on both smartphones and via the Web, e.g.  M (virtual assistant) on both Facebook and Facebook Messenger apps or via the Web\nBuilt into a mobile operating system (OS), as are Apple's Siri on iOS devices and BlackBerry Assistant on BlackBerry 10 devices, or into a desktop OS such as Cortana on Microsoft Windows OS\nBuilt into a smartphone independent of the OS, as is Bixby on the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Note 8.\nWithin instant messaging platforms, assistants from specific organizations, such as Aeromexico's Aerobot on Facebook Messenger or WeChat Secretary.\nWithin mobile apps from specific companies and other organizations, such as Dom from Domino's Pizza\nIn appliances, cars, and wearable technology such as the Ai Pin\nPrevious generations of virtual assistants often worked on websites, such as Alaska Airlines' Ask Jenn, or on interactive voice response (IVR) systems such as American Airlines' IVR by Nuance.\n\n\n== Services ==\nVirtual assistants can provide a wide variety of services. These include:\n\nProvide information such as weather, facts from e.g. Wikipedia or IMDb, set an alarm, make to-do lists and shopping lists\nPlay music from streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora; play radio stations; read audiobooks\nPlay videos, TV shows or movies on televisions, streaming from e.g. Netflix\nConversational commerce (see below)\nAssist public interactions with government (see Artificial intelligence in government)\nComplement and/or replace human customer service specialists in domains like healthcare, sales, and banking. One report estimated that an automated online assistant produced a 30% decrease in the work-load for a human-provided call centre.\nEnhance the driving experience by enabling interaction with virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa while in the car.\n\n\n=== Conversational commerce ===\n\nConversational commerce is e-commerce via various means of messaging, including via voice assistants but also live chat on e-commerce Web sites, live chat on messaging applications such as WeChat, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and chatbots on messaging applications or Web sites.\n\n\n=== Customer support ===\n\nA virtual assistant can work with customer support team of a business to provide 24x7 support to customers. It provides quick responses, which enhances a customer's experience.\n\n\n=== Third-party services ===\nAmazon enables Alexa \"Skills\" and Google \"Actions\", essentially applications that run on the assistant platforms.\n\n\n== Privacy ==\n\nVirtual assistants have a variety of privacy concerns associated with them. Features such as activation by voice pose a threat, as such features requires the device to always be listening. Modes of privacy such as the virtual security button have been proposed to create a multilayer authentication for virtual assistants.\n\n\n=== Google Assistant ===\nThe privacy policy of Google Assistant states that it does not store the audio data without the user's permission, but may store the conversation transcripts to personalise its experience. Personalisation can be turned off in settings. If a user wants Google Assistant to store audio data, they can go to Voice & Audio Activity (VAA) and turn on this feature. Audio files are sent to the cloud and used by Google to improve the performance of Google Assistant, but only if the VAA feature is turned on.\n\n\n=== Amazon Alexa ===\nThe privacy policy of Amazon's virtual assistant, Alexa, states that it only listens to conversations when its wake word (like Alexa, Amazon, Echo) is used. It starts recording the conversation after the call of a wake word, and stops recording after 8 seconds of silence. It sends the recorded conversation to the cloud. It is possible to delete the recording from the cloud by visiting 'Alexa Privacy' in 'Alexa'.\n\n\n=== Apple's Siri ===\nApple states that it does not record audio to improve Siri. Instead, it claims to use transcripts. Transcript data is only sent if it is deemed important for analysis. Users can opt out anytime if they don't want Siri to send the transcripts in the cloud.\n\n\n=== Cortana ===\nCortana is a voice-only virtual assistant with singular authentication. This voice-activated device accesses user data to perform common tasks like checking weather or making calls, raising privacy concerns due to the lack of secondary authentication.\n\n\n== Consumer interest ==\n\n\n=== Presumed added value as allowing a new way of interactions ===\nAdded value of the virtual assistants can come among others from the following:\n\nVoice communication can sometimes represent the optimal man-machine communication:\nIt is convenient: there are some sectors where voice is the only way of possible communication, and more generally, it allows to free-up both hands and vision potentially for doing another activity in parallel, or helps also disabled people.\nIt is faster: Voice is more efficient than writing on a keyboard: we can speak up to 200 words per minute opposed to 60 in case of writing on a keyboard. It is also more natural thus requiring less effort (reading a text however can reach 700 words per minute).\nVirtual assistants save a lot of time by automation: they can take appointments, or read the news while the consumer does something else. It is also possible to ask the virtual assistant to schedule meetings, hence helping to organize time. The designers of new digital schedulers explained the ambition they had that these calendars schedule lives to make the consumer use his time more efficiently, through machine learning processes, and complete organization of work time and free time.  As an example when the consumer expresses the desire of scheduling a break, the VA will schedule it at an optimal moment for this purpose (for example at a time of the week where they are less productive), with the additional long-term objective of being able to schedule and organize the free time of the consumer, to assure them optimal work efficiency.\n\n\n=== Perceived interest ===\n\nAccording to a recent study (2019), the two reasons for using virtual assistants for consumers are perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment. The first result of this study is that both perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment have an equivalent very strong influence for the consumer willingness to use a virtual assistant.\nThe second result of this study is that:\nProvided content quality has a very strong influence on perceived usefulness and a strong influence on perceived enjoyment.\nVisual attractiveness has a very strong influence on perceived enjoyment.\nAutomation has a strong influence on perceived usefulness.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Artificial intelligence controversies ===\nVirtual assistants spur the filter bubble: As for social media, virtual assistants' algorithms are trained to show pertinent data and discard others based on previous activities of the consumer: The pertinent data is the one which will interest or please the consumer. As a result, they become isolated from data that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them into their own intellectual bubble, and reinforcing their opinions. This phenomenon was known to reinforce fake news and echo chambers.\nVirtual assistants are also sometimes criticized for being overrated. In particular, A. Casilli points out that the AI of virtual assistants are neither intelligent nor artificial for two reasons:\nNot intelligent because all they do is being the assistant of the human, and only by doing tasks that a human could do easily, and in a very limited specter of actions: find, class, and present information, offers or documents. Also, virtual assistants are neither able to make decisions on their own nor to anticipate things.\nAnd not artificial because they would be impossible without human labelization through micro working.\n\n\n=== Ethical implications ===\nIn 2019 Antonio A. Casilli, a French sociologist, criticized artificial intelligence and virtual assistants in particular in the following way:\nAt a first level the fact that the consumer provides free data for the training and improvement of the virtual assistant, often without knowing it, is ethically disturbing.\nBut at a second level, it might be even more ethically disturbing to know how these AIs are trained with this data.\nThis artificial intelligence is trained via neural networks, which require a huge amount of labelled data. However, this data needs to be labelled through a human process, which explains the rise of microwork in the last decade. That is, remotely using some people worldwide doing some repetitive and very simple tasks for a few cents, such as listening to virtual assistant speech data, and writing down what was said. Microwork has been criticized for the job insecurity it causes, and for the total lack of regulation: The average salary was 1,38 dollar/hour in 2010, and it provides neither healthcare nor retirement benefits, sick pay, minimum wage. Hence, virtual assistants and their designers are controversial for spurring job insecurity, and the AIs they propose are still human in the way that they would be impossible without the microwork of millions of human workers.\nPrivacy concerns are raised by the fact that voice commands are available to the providers of virtual assistants in unencrypted form, and can thus be shared with third parties and be processed in an unauthorized or unexpected manner. Additionally to the linguistic content of recorded speech, a user's manner of expression and voice characteristics can implicitly contain information about his or her biometric identity, personality traits, body shape, physical and mental health condition, sex, gender, moods and emotions, socioeconomic status and geographical origin.\n\n\n== Developer platforms ==\nNotable developer platforms for virtual assistants include:\n\nAmazon Lex was opened to developers in April 2017. It involves natural language understanding technology combined with automatic speech recognition and had been introduced in November 2016.\nGoogle provides the Actions on Google and Dialogflow platforms for developers to create \"Actions\" for Google Assistant\nApple provides SiriKit for developers to create extensions for Siri\nIBM's Watson, while sometimes spoken of as a virtual assistant is in fact an entire artificial intelligence platform and community powering some virtual assistants, chatbots. and many other types of solutions.\n\n\n=== Previous generations ===\nIn previous generations of text chat-based virtual assistants, the assistant was often represented by an avatar (a.k.a. interactive online character or automated character) — this was known as an embodied agent.\n\n\n== Economic relevance ==\n\n\n=== For individuals ===\nDigital experiences enabled by virtual assistants are considered to be among the major recent technological advances and most promising consumer trends. Experts claim that digital experiences will achieve a status-weight comparable to 'real' experiences, if not become more sought-after and prized. The trend is verified by a high number of frequent users and the substantial growth of worldwide user numbers of virtual digital assistants. In mid-2017, the number of frequent users of digital virtual assistants is estimated to be around 1 bn worldwide. In addition, it can be observed that virtual digital assistant technology is no longer restricted to smartphone applications, but present across many industry sectors (incl. automotive, telecommunications, retail, healthcare and education).\nIn response to the significant R&D expenses of firms across all sectors and an increasing implementation of mobile devices, the market for speech recognition technology is predicted to grow at a CAGR of 34.9% globally over the period of 2016 to 2024 and thereby surpass a global market size of US$7.5 billion by 2024. According to an Ovum study, the \"native digital assistant installed base\" is projected to exceed the world's population by 2021, with 7.5 billion active voice AI–capable devices. According to Ovum, by that time \"Google Assistant will dominate the voice AI–capable device market with 23.3% market share, followed by Samsung's Bixby (14.5%), Apple's Siri (13.1%), Amazon's Alexa (3.9%), and Microsoft's Cortana (2.3%).\"\nTaking into consideration the regional distribution of market leaders, North American companies (e.g. Nuance Communications, IBM, eGain) are expected to dominate the industry over the next years, due to the significant impact of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) and enterprise mobility business models. Furthermore, the increasing demand for smartphone-assisted platforms are expected to further boost the North American intelligent virtual assistant (IVA) industry growth. Despite its smaller size in comparison to the North American market, the intelligent virtual assistant industry from the Asia-Pacific region, with its main players located in India and China is predicted to grow at an annual growth rate of 40% (above global average) over the 2016–2024 period.\n\n\n=== Economic opportunity for enterprises ===\nVirtual assistants should not be only seen as a gadget for individuals, as they could have a real economic utility for enterprises. As an example, a virtual assistant can take the role of an always available assistant with an encyclopedic knowledge. And which can organize meetings, check inventories, verify informations. Virtual assistants are all the more important that their integration in small and middle-sized enterprises often consists in an easy first step through the more global adaptation and use of Internet of Things (IoT). Indeed, IoT technologies are first perceived by small and medium-sized enterprises as technologies of critical importance, but too complicated, risky or costly to be used.\n\n\n== Security ==\nIn May 2018, researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, published a paper that showed audio commands undetectable for the human ear could be directly embedded into music or spoken text, thereby manipulating virtual assistants into performing certain actions without the user taking note of it. The researchers made small changes to audio files, which cancelled out the sound patterns that speech recognition systems are meant to detect. These were replaced with sounds that would be interpreted differently by the system and command it to dial phone numbers, open websites or even transfer money. The possibility of this has been known since 2016, and affects devices from Apple, Amazon and Google.\nIn addition to unintentional actions and voice recording, another security and privacy risk associated with intelligent virtual assistants is malicious voice commands: An attacker who impersonates a user and issues malicious voice commands to, for example, unlock a smart door to gain unauthorized entry to a home or garage or order items online without the user's knowledge. Although some IVAs provide a voice-training feature to prevent such impersonation, it can be difficult for the system to distinguish between similar voices. Thus, a malicious person who is able to access an IVA-enabled device might be able to fool the system into thinking that they are the real owner and carry out criminal or mischievous acts.\n\n\n== Comparison of notable assistants ==\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Help desk software is a computer program that enables customer-care operators to keep track of user requests and deal with other customer-care-related issues.\nGenerally, help desk software is part of an umbrella category called the service desk, which includes asset management and IT service management, and the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Help desk software specifically refers to the system that addresses customer queries.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe history of help desk software dates back to the 20th century when businesses relied mostly on face-to-face interaction to resolve customer issues. Customers had to visit a company’s store or office with the product to get their problems solved.\nWith the invention of the telephone in 1876 and the telephone switchboard in the 1890s, the help desk assumed a better approach. Customers were able to reach their company and voice out their problem over the phone system. During the 20th-century era, companies used mainly equipment like dictation machines, typewriters, and dumb terminals with access to a mainframe computer, to address customer issues. The earliest use of computers for customer service was done through the use of mainframe software. Customers would submit paper forms or communicate their issue by phone to customer service agents who would seek avenues to handle the issues.\nIn the 1960s, companies began to set up call centers and also train staff to receive and handle customer inquiries in an organized and efficient manner. This was the era of Interactive voice response (IVR) which became a big boost to the telephone customer service system. Later on, Desktop PCs and email significantly improved help desk systems. Customers could communicate their problems by email, bypassing paper forms. Help desk agents could provide status updates and resolutions by email as well.\nMeanwhile, the actual introduction of help desk systems began in 1980 when the internet was officially made available for public use. Many companies started outsourcing their customer service department. This led to the massive use of email and live chat systems in the 1990s. This new development enabled several US companies to outsource their help desk to low-cost countries like India and the Philippines.\nIn the 2000s, companies began to use diverse kinds of software packages to deal with customer-care issues. This led to the massive production of different kinds of help desk software programs across the internet and the world at large. In recent times, the internet and networked systems make help desk software more interactive and participatory for customers and agents. Customer can now submit and track their issues more easily.\nCustomer service and help desk software systems have become increasingly popular in recent times. According to a recent report, there is a massive increase in sales of customer relationship management (CRM) software, which includes help desk software across the globe.\n\n\n== Basic characteristics ==\nHelp desk software automates customer services in diverse ways. It typically consists of at least three parts. These include Ticket Management, Automation Suite, and Reporting/Optimization.\nHelp desk software has a point of contact for customers to send their queries and a ticketing system that tracks and organizes issues for faster resolution. It may also have a feature that aggregates and organizes queries and answers into a knowledge base, such as FAQs or guide articles. It may accommodate multiple points of contact; a working dashboard; and an analytics section. It may also have a feature that allows agents to escalate issues to a higher level.\nMore advanced help desk applications feature online chat, insights and analytics, automated processes, multiple contact channels, reporting tools, collaboration tools, and a CRM feature.\n\n\n== Benefits ==\nThe following benefits are typically associated with help desk software:\n\nAny business that uses webmail for support tends to resolve customer support issues quicker and sees an increase in support productivity when they switch to help desk software.\nHelp desk software automates tasks such as: ticket categorization and prioritization, ticket routing, alerts and notifications, ticket status management, and so on. With the right help desk solution, the workload is cut down as many tasks such as issue tracking, assigning, and ticket management can be automated.\nSome cloud-based help desk software has built-in security features, such as HIPAA compliance if for handling US health care information, or GDPR compliance for accepting requests from persons located in the European Union.\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nThere are some disadvantages related to help desk software as well, mainly:\n\nMany help desk software platforms have expensive upfront costs as well as time-consuming implementation periods, which can significantly drain company resources. While most offer a trial option, effectively trialing software is difficult and time-consuming in a large organization. It's also difficult to evaluate the software with a full volume of tickets and staff in a short period of time.\nOn-premises help desks can have costs associated with maintenance, upgrades, and scheduled downtime of servers, which are borne by the customer, not the help desk software provider.\nCloud-based help desks can incur higher costs over longer periods of time. Cloud-based help desk software can become partially or entirely unavailable to users without an Internet connection. Consequently, unexpected disruptions in Internet connection may make such services temporarily unavailable.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCustomer service\nCustomer support\nHelp desk\nIssue tracking system\nTechnical support\nComparison of help desk issue tracking software\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Chime Financial, Inc. is an American financial technology company, based in San Francisco, California, that provides fee-free mobile banking services through two national banks, Stride Bank and The Bancorp Bank.\nThe company offers early access to paychecks, negative account balances without overdraft fees, high-yield savings accounts, peer-to-peer payments, and an interest-free secured credit card. Chime's mobile banking services do not rely on monthly service or overdraft fees or minimum balance requirements. Chime earns the majority of its revenue from the collection of interchange fees on debit card transactions.\nChime is able to offer its services via its relationships with banks despite the company not being a bank itself; customer funds are routed to a chartered bank. FDIC insurance is only available to users via the partnered banks, not directly through Chime, so customers may not be protected against some failures. In 2021 and 2022, Chime was criticized for closing customer accounts without notice and not returning funds in a timely manner. The company was penalized for the use of the word \"bank\" in its marketing, following which it agreed to include disclaimers that Chime is not a bank in its marketing materials. In 2024, Chime was fined for poor handling of customer complaints and agreed to upgrade its customer service. On June 12, 2025, Chime became public via an initial public offering.\n\n\n== History ==\nChime was founded by Chris Britt (CEO) and Ryan King (CTO) in 2012 in San Francisco, California as an alternative to traditional banking to serve less affluent communities and people living paycheck to paycheck. The company launched on April 15, 2014, on the Dr. Phil Show. As of 2021, Chime has raised $2.3 billion in private funding. In 2022, Chime was named as one of Fortune's Best Places to Work.\nOn October 16, 2019, Chime experienced a service outage leaving users without access to their deposits. The issue was resolved the next day.\nIn January 2020, Chime announced a partnership with the Dallas Mavericks as their jersey sponsor as a part of a multi-year deal. Chime had 8 million account holders in February 2020.\nIn April 2020, in response to the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chime announced a pilot program to provide users who e-filed tax returns with the IRS a $1,200 advance on the Economic Stimulus Payment via SpotMe, Chime's fee-free overdraft product. Chime later announced the successful processing of over $375 million in stimulus payments one week ahead of the scheduled government disbursement date.\nIn September 2021, Chime leased 192,000 square feet of office space across six floors in a San Francisco building owned by Hines. According to a report by Forbes, Chime had planned to hold an initial public offering (IPO) in March 2022. The company delayed its IPO, however, in February 2022. Chime laid off 160 positions, equalling 12% of its workforce, in November 2022. As of May 2024, the company, which operates under a hybrid work model, reported having 1,300 employees and 7 million customers. At the time, it was processing $8 billion worth of transactions monthly. Chime's revenue in 2023 was approximately $1.3 billion. The company's customers are largely made up of young Americans with incomes ranging from $35,000 to $65,000 annually.\nIn August 2021, Chime Financial raised $750 million in a series G funding round, led by investor Sequoia Capital Global Equities, giving the company a valuation of about $25 billion.\nIn 2024, Chime was named to the CNBC Disruptor 50 list and had approximately 22 million customers.\nChime issued publicly traded stock on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “CHYM” in June, 2025. Chime went public on June 12 after raising $864 million in its IPO, valuing the company at $11.6 billion.\n\n\n=== Investors ===\nSome of Chime’s notable early investors include seed investors Satya Patel of Homebrew and Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures; Series A investors Lauren Kolodny of Acrew Capital (formerly Aspect Ventures) and Crosslink Capital. Later rounds included Menlo Ventures, DST, General Atlantic and Coatue.\n\n\n== Consumer and regulatory problems ==\n\n\n=== Marketing as a bank ===\nChime, which is not a bank, in 2021 came to agreements with two state financial regulators, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation, to stop representing itself as a bank. The company agreed to stop using the URL \"chimebank.com\", change its use of the word \"bank\" in marketing, and add disclaimers to its marketing and product text. It paid $200,000 in the settlement with Illinois.\n\n\n=== Account closures, difficulty recovering deposits ===\nIn July 2021, ProPublica published an article detailing Chime's record of closing customer accounts without notice or explanation, sometimes refusing to return customer deposits. Chime has attributed the closures to the accidental byproduct of fraud prevention.\nIn 2022, Chime's practice of closing customer accounts without notice or explanation was again reported. The company has no obligation to provide a reason to close an account. As of the November, 2022 report the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had received 3,500 complaints about Chime since the beginning of 2020. Customers with closed accounts sometimes had difficulty retrieving their deposits in a timely fashion. Since Chime customers are not customers of any bank, their recourse is often limited.\nThe U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in 2024 assessed a $3.25 million penalty plus at least $1.3 million in redress to customers for not returning deposits from closed accounts in a timely manner. Until 2021 Chime's customer service agreement said deposits would be issued by check, mailed within 14 days. Thousands of customers waited 90 days or longer. The settlement gives at least $150 in redress to any customer who had a $10 balance after 14 days from account closure. The $3.25 million penalty was paid to the CFPB victims relief fund. The company attributed the problem to a \"configuration error\" in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n=== Handling customer complaints ===\nIn 2024 Chime entered into a consent order with the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) and paid a $2.5 million penalty to resolve an investigation into the company's customer service. The DFPI found that customer complaints were not being handled fairly, accurately, and in a timely manner in compliance with the California Consumer Financial Protection law. The company agreed to provide 24-hour 7-days per week customer service support with sufficient training and staffing to be in compliance. Chime agreed to report on its compliance to DFPI for two years.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\nChime offers various fee-free banking products, including checking accounts with no minimum balance, an automated savings feature, high-yield savings accounts, peer-to-peer payments, and an early paycheck feature.\nIn September 2019, Chime launched SpotMe, a fee-free overdraft service where customers can overdraw their accounts up to $100 without incurring an overdraft fee; once the overdraft limit is reached, purchases will be declined but no traditional negative balance fees charged.\nChime launched Credit Builder with Stride Bank, N.A in June 2020, which is a credit card designed to help consumers build their credit history. Chime was the most downloaded digital banking app in the U.S. during the first half of 2021, according to data collected by Apptopia.\nIn 2024, Chime launched MyPay, an earned wage access (EWA) product which allows users to access up to $500 of wages prior to payday. MyPay has no mandatory fees or interest, and it does not require a credit check.\nIn 2025, Chime began offering federal and state tax filing services on its app.\n\n\n== Customer service ==\nAs of January 2025, Chime has a 'B-' rating from the Better Business Bureau (BBB), with 8,000 customer complaints during the previous 3 years.\nChime has no physical branches and does not charge monthly or overdraft fees, nor does it require an opening deposit or minimum balance to open a free checking account. Bank accounts that are provided via Chime's partners are FDIC insured up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000, however FDIC bank insurance on Chime accounts does not directly protect Chime's customers. Accounts are only available for individuals of personal accounts; all money received must be in the name of the individual account owner. Customers cannot appeal to banking regulators to retrieve their deposits, which may not be returned in a timely fashion.\nChime can close user accounts with no notice, it is not required to provide a reason for the cancellation to the customer. Chime's partner banks have a duty under “know your customer” rules to guard against money-laundering or other suspicious activity, including closing down suspicious accounts.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChallenger bank\nFinancial technology\nPayment card industry\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "The complaint tablet to Ea-nāṣir (UET V 81) is a clay tablet that was sent to the ancient city-state Ur, written c. 1750 BC. The tablet, which measures 11.6 centimetres (4+9⁄16 in) high and 5.0 centimetres (1+15⁄16 in) wide, documents a transaction in which Ea-nāṣir, a trader, allegedly sold sub-standard copper to a customer named Nanni. Nanni, dissatisfied with the quality, wrote a cuneiform complaint addressing the poor service and mistreatment of his servant.\nDiscovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in Ur, it is currently kept in the British Museum. Written in Akkadian cuneiform, this tablet is recognized as the \"Oldest Customer Complaint\" by Guinness World Records. From 2015 onwards, the tablet's content and Ea-nāṣir in particular gained popularity as an internet meme, due to its relatable subject matter in expressing dissatisfaction with goods.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe tablet is 11.6 centimetres (4+9⁄16 in) high, 5.0 cm (1+15⁄16 in) wide, 2.6 cm (1 in) thick, and slightly damaged.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\nThe tablet details that Ea-nāṣir travelled to Dilmun to buy copper and returned to sell it in Mesopotamia. On one particular occasion, he had agreed to sell copper ingots to Nanni. Nanni sent his servant with the money to complete the transaction. The copper was considered by Nanni to be sub-standard and was not accepted.\nIn response, Nanni produced the cuneiform letter for delivery to Ea-nāṣir. Inscribed on it is a complaint to Ea-nāṣir about a copper delivery of the incorrect grade and issues with another delivery; Nanni also complained that his servant (who handled the transaction) had been treated rudely. He stated that, at the time of writing, he had not accepted the copper, but had paid for it.\nEa-nāṣir was part of a group of traders called alik Tilmun, or \"Dilmun traders\". He is known from other texts to have been active in the 11th and 19th regnal years of the Larsa ruler Rim-Sîn I.\n\n\n== Acquisition ==\n\nThe tablet was discovered and acquired by Sir Leonard Woolley, leading a joint expedition of the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum from 1922 to 1934 in the Sumerian city of Ur.\n\n\n== Translations ==\nAdolf Leo Oppenheim translated several of the tablet's lines in a 1954 article for Journal of the American Oriental Society. An English language translation of the tablet was made by W. F. Leemans in 1960; Leemans's translation incorporated these lines which Oppenheim had translated as well as some input from Fritz Rudolf Kraus on the meaning of a few lines. Oppenheim published a full translation of the tablet himself in 1967, unaware of any other translations of this tablet. A translation inspired by that of Marc Van de Mieroop sent in a personal communication to Steven J. Garfinkle was published in 2010; a book review by Walter Farber noted that this translation \"is not always true to details\". I. M. Diakonoff published a translation into Russian in 1990.\n\n\n== Other tablets ==\nOther tablets have been found in the ruins believed to be Ea-nāṣir's dwelling. These include a letter from a man named Arbituram who complained he had not received his copper yet, while another said he was tired of receiving bad copper.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe complaint tablet has become an Internet meme due to its seemingly anachronistic nature. It has been recognized by the Guinness World Records as the \"oldest written customer complaint\". In 2009, the tablet was stabilised with Paraloid B-72.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n\"British Museum Object\". British Museum.

        "content": "A call centre (Commonwealth spelling) or call center (American spelling; see spelling differences) is a managed capability that can be centralised or remote that is used for receiving or transmitting a large volume of enquiries by telephone. An inbound call centre is operated by a company to administer incoming product or service support or information inquiries from consumers. Outbound call centres are usually operated for sales purposes such as telemarketing, for solicitation of charitable or political donations, debt collection, market research, emergency notifications, and urgent/critical needs blood banks. A contact centre is a further extension of call centres' telephony based capabilities, administering centralised handling of individual communications including letters, faxes, live support software, social media, instant message, and email.\nA call center was previously seen as an open workspace for call center agents, with workstations that included a computer and display for each agent and were connected to an inbound/outbound call management system, and one or more supervisor stations. It can be independently operated or networked with additional centers, often linked to a corporate computer network, including mainframes, microcomputer, servers and LANs. It is expected that artificial intelligence-based chatbots will significantly impact call centre jobs and will increase productivity substantially. Many organisations have already adopted AI-based chatbots to improve their customer service experience.\nThe contact center is a central point from which all customer contacts are managed. Through contact centers, valuable information can be routed to the appropriate people or systems, contacts can be tracked, and data may be gathered. It is generally a part of the company's customer relationship management infrastructure. The majority of large companies use contact centers as a means of managing their customer interactions. These centers can be operated by either an in-house department responsible or outsourcing customer interaction to a third-party agency (known as Outsourcing Call Centres).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAnswering services, as known in the 1960s through the 1980s, earlier and slightly later, involved a business that specifically provided the service. Primarily, by using an off-premises extension (OPX) for each subscribing business, connected at a switchboard at the answering service business, the answering service would answer the otherwise unattended phones of the subscribing businesses with a live operator. The live operator could take messages or relay information, doing so with greater human interactivity than a mechanical answering machine. Although undoubtedly more costly (the human service, the cost of setting up and paying the phone company for the OPX on a monthly basis), it had the advantage of being more ready to respond to the unique needs of after-hours callers. The answering service operators also had the option of calling the client and alerting them to particularly important calls.\nThe origins of call centers date back to the 1960s with the UK-based Birmingham Press and Mail, which installed Private Automated Business Exchanges (PABX) to have rows of agents handling customer contacts. By 1973, call centers had received mainstream attention after Rockwell International patented its Galaxy Automatic Call Distributor (GACD) for a telephone booking system as well as the popularization of telephone headsets as seen on televised NASA Mission Control Center events.\nDuring the late 1970s, call center technology expanded to include telephone sales, airline reservations, and banking systems. The term \"call center\" was first published and recognised by the Oxford English Dictionary in 1983. The 1980s saw the development of toll-free telephone numbers to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume. Call centers increased with the deregulation of long-distance calling and growth in information-dependent industries.\nAs call centres expanded, workers in North America began to join unions such as the Communications Workers of America and the United Steelworkers. In Australia, the National Union of Workers represents unionised workers; their activities form part of the Australian labour movement. In Europe, UNI Global Union of Switzerland is involved in assisting unionisation in the call center industry, and in Germany Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft represents call centre workers.\nDuring the 1990s, call centres expanded internationally and developed into two additional subsets of communication: contact centres and outsourced bureau centres. A contact centre is a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies, and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organization. In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a \"pay per use\" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact centre includes automated call blending of inbound and outbound calls as well as predictive dialing capabilities, dramatically increasing agents' productivity. New implementations of more complex systems require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use multichannel online and offline tools to improve customer interactions.\n\n\n== Technology ==\n\nCall centre technologies often include: speech recognition software which allowed Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems to handle first levels of customer support, text mining, natural language processing to allow better customer handling, agent training via interactive scripting and automatic mining using best practices from past interactions, support automation and many other technologies to improve agent productivity and customer satisfaction. Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies, both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in.\nFor outbound calls, lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors, past performance, and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.\nThe universal queue standardises the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email. The virtual queue provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.\n\n\n=== Premises-based technology ===\nHistorically call centres have been built on Private branch exchange (PBX) equipment owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator. The PBX can provide functions such as automatic call distribution, interactive voice response, and skills-based routing.\n\n\n=== Virtual call centre ===\n\nIn a virtual call centre model, the call centre operator (business) pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony and data equipment in their own facility, cloud-based. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment on which the call centre runs. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional PSTN telephone lines, or over voice over IP. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premises. The vendor's telephony equipment (at times data servers) then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.\nVirtual call centre technology allows customer service representatives to operate remotely, connecting to the organisation’s telephony and CRM systems via cloud infrastructure instead of working from a central office. This approach promotes greater accessibility for individuals with disabilities and supports distributed or hybrid workforce models across different regions. The only required equipment is Internet access, a workstation, and a softphone. If the virtual call centre software utilizes webRTC, a softphone is not required to dial. The companies are preferring Virtual Call Centre services due to cost advantage. Companies can start their call centre business immediately without installing the basic infrastructure like Dialer, ACD and IVRS.\nVirtual call centres became increasingly used after the COVID-19 pandemic restricted businesses from operating with large groups of people working in close proximity.\n\n\n=== Cloud computing ===\n\nThrough the use of application programming interfaces (APIs), hosted and on-demand call centres that are built on cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) platforms can integrate their functionality with cloud-based applications for customer relationship management (CRM), lead management and more.\nDevelopers use APIs to enhance cloud-based call centre platform functionality—including Computer telephony integration (CTI) APIs which provide basic telephony controls and sophisticated call handling from a separate application, and configuration APIs which enable graphical user interface (GUI) controls of administrative functions.\n\n\n=== Outsourcing ===\n\nOutsourced call centres are often located in developing countries, where wages are significantly lower than in western countries with higher minimum wages. These include the call centre industries in the Philippines, Bangladesh, and India.\nCompanies that regularly utilise outsourced contact centre services include British Sky Broadcasting and Orange in the telecommunications industry, Adidas in the sports and leisure sector, Audi in car manufacturing and charities such as the RSPCA.\n\n\n== Industries ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\nThe healthcare industry has and continues to use outbound call centre programmes for years to help manage billing, collections, and patient communication. The inbound call centre is a new and increasingly popular service for many types of healthcare facilities, including large hospitals. Inbound call centres can be outsourced or managed in-house.\nThese healthcare call centres are designed to help streamline communications, enhance patient retention and satisfaction, reduce expenses and improve operational efficiencies.\n\n\n=== Hospitality ===\nMany large hospitality companies such as the Hilton Hotels Corporation and Marriott International make use of call centres to manage reservations. These are known in the industry as \"central reservations offices\". Staff members at these call centres take calls from clients wishing to make reservations or other inquiries via a public number, usually a 1-800 number. These centres may operate as many as 24 hours per day, seven days a week, depending on the call volume the chain receives.\n\n\n== Evaluation ==\n\n\n=== Mathematical theory ===\n\nQueueing theory is a branch of mathematics in which models of service systems have been developed. A call centre can be seen as a queueing network and results from queueing theory such as the probability an arriving customer needs to wait before starting service useful for provisioning capacity. (Erlang's C formula is such a result for an M/M/c queue and approximations exist for an M/G/k queue.) Statistical analysis of call centre data has suggested arrivals are governed by an inhomogeneous Poisson process and jobs have a log-normal service time distribution. Simulation algorithms are increasingly being used to model call arrival, queueing and service levels.\nCall centre operations have been supported by mathematical models beyond queueing, with operations research, which considers a wide range of optimisation problems seeking to reduce waiting times while keeping server utilisation and therefore efficiency high.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nCall centres have received criticism for low rates of pay and restrictive working practices for employees, which have been deemed as a dehumanising environment. Other research illustrates how call centre workers develop ways to counter or resist this environment by integrating local cultural sensibilities or embracing a vision of a new life. Most call centres provide electronic reports that outline performance metrics, quarterly highlights and other information about the calls made and received. This has the benefit of helping the company to plan the workload and time of its employees. However, it has also been argued that such close monitoring breaches the human right to privacy.\nComplaints are often logged by callers who find the staff do not have enough skill or authority to resolve problems, as well as appearing apathetic. These concerns are due to a business process that exhibits levels of variability because the experience a customer gets and results a company achieves on a given call are dependent upon the quality of the agent. Call centres are beginning to address this by using agent-assisted automation to standardise the process all agents use. However, more popular alternatives are using personality and skill based approaches. The various challenges encountered by call operators are discussed by several authors.\n\n\n== Media portrayals ==\nCall centres located in India have been the focus of several documentary films: the 2004 film Thomas L. Friedman Reporting: The Other Side of Outsourcing, the 2005 films John and Jane, Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night, 1-800-India: Importing a White-Collar Economy, and the 2006 film Bombay Calling, among others. An Indian call centre is also the subject of the 2006 film Outsourced and a key location in the 2008 film, Slumdog Millionaire. The 2014 BBC fly on the wall documentary series The Call Centre gave an often distorted although humorous view of life in a Welsh call centre.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomatic call distributor\nBusiness process outsourcing\nCall management\nList of call centre companies\nPredictive dialling\nOperator messaging\nQueue management system\nSkills based routing\nThe Call Centre, a BBC fly-on-the-wall documentary at a Welsh call centre\nVirtual queue\n Business portal\n Telephones portal\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to call centres at Wikimedia Commons\nMandelbaum, Avishai Call Centers (Centres) Research Bibliography with Abstracts Archived 2017-04-29 at the Wayback Machine.

        "content": "A network operations center (NOC, pronounced like the word knock), also known as a \"network management center\", is one or more locations from which network monitoring and control, or network management, is exercised over a computer, telecommunication or satellite network.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest NOCs started during the 1960s. A Network Control Center was opened in New York by AT&T in 1962 which used status boards to display switch and routing information, in real-time, from AT&T's most important toll switches. AT&T later replaced this Network Control Center with a modernized NOC in 1977, located in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\n\n== Purpose ==\nNOCs are implemented by business organizations, public utilities, universities, and government agencies that oversee complex networking environments that require high availability. NOC personnel are responsible for monitoring one or many networks for certain conditions that may require special attention to avoid degraded service. Organizations may operate more than one NOC, either to manage different networks or to provide geographic redundancy in the event of one site becoming unavailable.\nIn addition to monitoring internal and external networks of related infrastructure, NOCs can monitor social networks to get a head-start on disruptive events.\n\n\n== Networking environments ==\n\n\n=== Computer ===\nComputer environments can range in size from one to millions of servers.\n\n\n=== Telecommunication ===\nIn telecommunication environments, NOCs are responsible for monitoring power failures, communication line alarms (such as bit errors, framing errors, line coding errors, and circuits down) and other performance issues that may affect the network, and in telecom sector have to track details about the call flow.\n\n\n=== Satellite ===\nSatellite network environments process large amounts of voice and video data, in addition to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information. Example organizations that manage this form of NOC includes Artel, a service provider of commercial satellite bandwidth to the United States Department of Defense, located in Herndon, Virginia.\n\n\n== Design ==\nNOCs are frequently laid out with several rows of desks, all facing a video wall, which typically shows details of highly significant alarms, ongoing incidents and general network performance; a corner of the wall is sometimes used for showing a news or weather TV channel, as this can keep the NOC technicians aware of current events which may affect the network or systems they are responsible for. The back wall of a NOC is sometimes glazed; there may be a room attached to this wall which is used by members of the team responsible for dealing with serious incidents to meet while still able to watch events unfolding within the NOC. Individual desks are generally assigned to a specific network, technology or area. A technician may have several computer monitors on their desk, with the extra monitors used for monitoring the systems or networks covered from that desk. The location housing a NOC may also contain many or all of the primary servers and other equipment essential to running the network, although it is not uncommon for a single NOC to monitor and control a number of geographically dispersed sites.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n\n=== NOC engineers ===\nA NOC engineer has several duties in order to ensure the smooth running of the network. They deal with things such as DDoS attacks, power outages, network failures, and routing black-holes. There are of course the basic roles, such as remote hands, support, configuration of hardware (such as firewalls and routers, purchased by a client). NOC engineers also have to ensure the core network is stable. This can be done by configuring hardware in a way that makes the network more secure, but still has optimal performance. NOC engineers are also responsible for monitoring activity, such as network usage, temperatures etc. They would also have to install equipment, such as KVMs, rack installation, IP-PDU setup, running cabling. The majority of NOC engineers are also on call and have a five or six day rotation, working different shifts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCentral apparatus room\nControl room\nData center\nData center management\nInternet exchange point\nMaster control\nNetOps\nSecurity operations center\nInformation security operations center\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWhat is a NOC",

        "content": "An Air Operations Center (AOC) is a type of command center used by the United States Air Force (USAF).  It is the senior agency of the Air Force component commander to provide command and control of air operations.\nThe United States Air Force employs two kinds of AOCs: regional AOCs (pronounced \"Kay-ock\") utilizing the AN/USQ-163 Falconer weapon system that support geographic combatant commanders, and functional AOCs that support functional combatant commanders. When there is more than one U.S. military service working in an AOC, such as when naval aviation from the U.S. Navy (USN) and/or the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) is incorporated, it is called a Joint Air Operations Center (JAOC). In cases of allied or coalition (multinational) operations in tandem with USAF or Joint air operations, the AOC is called a Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC).\nAn AOC is the senior element of the Theater Air Control System (TACS). The Joint Force Commander (JFC) assigns a Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) to lead the AOC weapon system.  If allied or coalition forces are part of the operation, the JFC and JFACC will be redesignated as the CFC and CFACC, respectively.\nQuite often the Commander, Air Force Forces (COMAFFOR) is assigned the JFACC/CFACC position for planning and executing theater-wide air forces.  If another service also provides a significant share of air forces, the Deputy JFACC/CFACC will typically be a senior flag officer from that service.  For example, during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, when USAF combat air forces (CAF) and mobility air forces (MAF) integrated extensive USN and USMC sea-based and land-based aviation and Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy / Fleet Air Arm aviation, the CFACC was an aeronautically rated USAF lieutenant general, assisted by an aeronautically designated USN rear admiral (upper half) as the Deputy CFACC, and an aeronautically rated RAF air commodore as the Senior British Officer (Air).\n\n\n== Battlecab ==\nThe Command element occupies the Battlecab, which houses offices for the senior leadership and provides oversight of the Combat Operations floor. \nThe Air Component Commander, normally a 3* NATO OF-8 (O-9) Lt General is the overall Commander of the Air Component and has oversight of their AOC. \nThere will usually be a 2* NATO OF-7 (O-8) Major General who is the Deputy CJFACC and has day to day command of the Air Component and oversight of the AOC. \nThe AOC Commander, would normally be a 1* NATO OF-6 (O-7) Brigadier General who commands the whole AOC facility and answers to the ACC. \nThere would then be at least 2 AOC Directors NATO OF-5 (O-6) Colonels who would oversee the Battlecab and maintain a 24/7 shift watch over all aspects of CAOC decision making.\n\n\n== Divisions ==\nThere are five divisions in the AOC. These separate, but distinct, organizations fuse information that eventually becomes the Air Tasking Order.  Staffing of these divisions consists primarily of USAF officers of various specialities in the ranks of captain, major and lieutenant colonel, supported by a smaller cohort of enlisted airmen, typically in the rank of staff sergeant and above.  When conducting joint air operations, U.S. Army and USMC officers of similar rank and USN officers in the ranks of lieutenant, lieutenant commander and commander will also provide augmentative manning as required, the majority of whom will be aeronautically rated/aeronautically designated.  Senior leadership oversight of the AOC is provided by USAF colonels and general officers and USN captains and flag officers.\n\n\n=== Strategy Division (SRD) ===\nStrategy Plans Team\nStrategy Guidance Team\nOperational Assessment Team\nInformation Operations Team\n\n\n=== Combat Plans Division (CPD) ===\nTarget Effects Team\nMaster Air Attack Plan Team\nAir Tasking Order Production Team\nCommand and Control Planning Team\n\n\n=== Combat Operations Division (COD) ===\nChief of Combat Operations (CCO) \"CRESCENT\"\nOffensive Ops Team - Led by the Senior Offensive Duty Officer (SODO) \"FIREBRAND\"\nElectronic Warfare Cell (EWC) \"LIGHTNING\"\nDynamic Targeting Cell (DTC) \"SANDMAN\"\nDefensive Ops Team - Led by the Senior Air Defence Officer (SADO) \"KMART\"\nISR Operations Team - Led by the Senior Intelligence Duty Officer (SIDO) \"BISHOP\"\nJoint Personnel Recovery Cell (JPRC) \"DELIVERENCE\"\nInterface Control - Led by the Joint Interface Control Officer (JICO), responsible for tactical datalinks and communications\nWeather Specialty Team \"CYCLONE\"\nCyber Liaison Team\nNaval Amphibious Liaison Element (NALE)\nUSN + USMC; NALE also provides personnel/support to CPD and ISRD\nBattlefield Coordination Detachment (BCD)\nSpecial Operations Liaison Element (SOLE)\n\n\n=== Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Division (ISRD) ===\nAnalysis, Correlation, and Fusion\nTargeting and Tactical Assessment\nImagery Support Element (ISE)\nISR Plans - Produce the ATO RSTA Annex for Collection Operations Management (COM)\n\n\n=== Air Mobility Division (AMD) ===\nAMD Chief\nDeputy AMD Chief\nSuperintendent\nAir Mobility Control Team (AMCT)\nExecution Cell\nMission Management\nFlight Management\nUSAPAT Mission Planner\nMaintenance\nAirlift Control Team (ALCT)\nAirlift Plans\nDV Airlifts\nDiplomatic Clearance\nRequirements\nAir Refueling Control Team (ARCT)\nAeromedical Evacuation Control Team (AECT)\nUnique Missions Support Team (AMDU)\n\n\n== Active Air Operations Centers ==\n\n\n== Inactive Air Operations Centers ==\n\n\n== AOC-equipping Units ==\n102d Air Operations Group – Otis ANGB, Cape Cod, Massachusetts (Massachusetts Air National Guard) \n103d Air Operations Group – East Granby, Connecticut (Connecticut Air National Guard) \n 193d Air Operations Group formally known as the 112th Air Operations Squadron – State College, Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Air National Guard)\n152d Air Operations Group – Hancock Field ANGB, Syracuse, New York (New York Air National Guard)\n 157th Air Operations Group – Jefferson Barracks, St Louis, Missouri (Missouri Air National Guard)\n183d Air Operations Group Capital Airport ANGS, Springfield, Illinois (Illinois Air National Guard)\n201st Air Operations Group - JB Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii (Hawaii Air National Guard)\n217th Air Operations Group – Kellogg ANGB, Battle Creek, Michigan (Michigan Air National Guard)\n321st Air Mobility Operations Squadron – Travis AFB, California (Air Mobility Command)\n349th Air Mobility Operations Squadron – Travis AFB, California (Air Force Reserve Command)\n514th Air Mobility Operations Squadron – McGuire AFB, New Jersey (Air Force Reserve Command)\n621st Air Mobility Operations Squadron – McGuire AFB, New Jersey (Air Mobility Command)\n701st Combat Operations Squadron – March ARB, California (Air Force Reserve Command)\nIn addition to its augmentation role to PACAF's 607 AOC at Osan AB, South Korea, the 701 COS established its own AOC facility in the former Southwest Air Defense Sector at March ARB (established 2004)\n710th Combat Operations Squadron – Langley AFB, Virginia (Air Force Reserve Command)\n\n\n== NATO CAOC ==\nSince July 2013 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) also uses the Combined Air Operations Centre concept at two locations (Torrejon, Spain and Uedem, Germany) with a deployable Air Operations Centre at Poggio Renatico, Italy. Previously, supporting the air component commands were 5 static Combined Air Operations Centres (CAOCs) to direct NATO air operations: in Finderup, Denmark; Eskişehir, Turkey; Larissa, Greece; Torrejon, Spain and Lisbon, Portugal.  There were 2 further CAOCs with a static as well as a deployable role; Uedem, Germany and Poggio Renatico. The static CAOCs can support Allied air operations from their fixed locations, while the deployable CAOC will move where they are needed.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nTheater Battle Management Core Systems\nGlobal Command and Control System – U.S. military decision support system\nAir Force Command and Control Integration Center\nJoint Electronics Type Designation System – Unclassified designation system for United States military electronic equipment\nList of military electronics of the United States\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Electronic mail (usually shortened to email; alternatively hyphenated e-mail) is a method of transmitting and receiving digital messages using electronic devices over a computer network. It was conceived in the late–20th century as the digital version of, or counterpart to, mail (hence e- + mail). Email is a ubiquitous and very widely used communication medium; in current use, an email address is often treated as a basic and necessary part of many processes in business, commerce, government, education, entertainment, and other spheres of daily life in most countries.\nEmail operates across computer networks, primarily the Internet, and also local area networks. Today's email systems are based on a store-and-forward model. Email servers accept, forward, deliver, and store messages. Neither the users nor their computers are required to be online simultaneously; they need to connect, typically to a mail server or a webmail interface to send or receive messages or download it.\nOriginally a text-only ASCII communications medium, Internet email was extended by MIME to carry text in expanded character sets and multimedia content such as images. International email, with internationalized email addresses using UTF-8, is standardized but not widely adopted.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe term electronic mail has been in use with its modern meaning since 1975, and variations of the shorter E-mail have been in use since 1979:\n\nemail is now the common form, and recommended by style guides. It is the form required by IETF Requests for Comments (RFC) and working groups.  This spelling also appears in most dictionaries.\ne-mail was originally the form favored in edited published American English and British English writing, and was formerly preferred by some style guides.\nE-mail is sometimes used. The original usage in June 1979 occurred in the journal Electronics in reference to the United States Postal Service initiative called E-COM, which was developed in the late 1970s and operated in the early 1980s.\nEMAIL was used by CompuServe starting in April 1981, which popularized the term.\nEMail is a traditional form used in RFCs for the \"Author's Address\".\nThe service is often simply referred to as mail, and a single piece of electronic mail is called a message. The conventions for fields within emails—the \"To\", \"From\", \"CC\", \"BCC\" etc.—began with RFC-680 in 1975.\nAn Internet email consists of an envelope and content; the content consists of a header and a body.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nComputer-based messaging between users of the same system became possible after the advent of time-sharing in the early 1960s, with a notable implementation by MIT's CTSS project in 1965. Most developers of early mainframes and minicomputers developed similar, but generally incompatible, mail applications. In 1971 the first ARPANET network mail was sent, introducing the now-familiar address syntax with the '@' symbol designating the user's system address. Over a series of RFCs, conventions were refined for sending mail messages over the File Transfer Protocol.\nProprietary electronic mail systems soon began to emerge. IBM, CompuServe and Xerox used in-house mail systems in the 1970s; CompuServe sold a commercial intraoffice mail product in 1978 to IBM and to Xerox from 1981. DEC's ALL-IN-1 and Hewlett-Packard's HPMAIL (later HP DeskManager) were released in 1982; development work on the former began in the late 1970s and the latter became the world's largest selling email system.\nThe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) was implemented on the ARPANET in 1983. LAN email systems emerged in the mid-1980s. For a time in the late 1980s and early 1990s, it seemed likely that either a proprietary commercial system or the X.400 email system, part of the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile (GOSIP), would predominate. However, once the final restrictions on carrying commercial traffic over the Internet ended in 1995, a combination of factors made the current Internet suite of SMTP, POP3 and IMAP email protocols the standard (see Protocol Wars).\n\n\n== Operation ==\nThe following is a typical sequence of events that takes place when sender Alice transmits a message using a mail user agent (MUA) addressed to the email address of the recipient.\n\nThe MUA formats the message in email format and uses the submission protocol, a profile of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), to send the message content to the local mail submission agent (MSA), in this case smtp.a.org.\nThe MSA determines the destination address provided in the SMTP protocol (not from the message header)—in this case, bob@b.org—which is a fully qualified domain address (FQDA). The part before the @ sign is the local part of the address, often the username of the recipient, and the part after the @ sign is a domain name. The MSA resolves a domain name to determine the fully qualified domain name of the mail server in the Domain Name System (DNS).\nThe DNS server for the domain b.org (ns.b.org) responds with any MX records listing the mail exchange servers for that domain, in this case mx.b.org, a message transfer agent (MTA) server run by the recipient's ISP.\nsmtp.a.org sends the message to mx.b.org using SMTP. This server may need to forward the message to other MTAs before the message reaches the final message delivery agent (MDA).\nThe MDA delivers it to the mailbox of user bob.\nBob's MUA picks up the message using either the Post Office Protocol (POP3) or the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).\nIn addition to this example, alternatives and complications exist in the email system:\n\nAlice or Bob may use a client connected to a corporate email system, such as IBM Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange. These systems often have their own internal email format and their clients typically communicate with the email server using a vendor-specific, proprietary protocol. The server sends or receives email via the Internet through the product's Internet mail gateway which also does any necessary reformatting. If Alice and Bob work for the same company, the entire transaction may happen completely within a single corporate email system.\nAlice may not have an MUA on her computer but instead may connect to a webmail service.\nAlice's computer may run its own MTA, so avoiding the transfer at step 1.\nBob may pick up his email in many ways, for example logging into mx.b.org and reading it directly, or by using a webmail service.\nDomains usually have several mail exchange servers so that they can continue to accept mail even if the primary is not available.\nMany MTAs used to accept messages for any recipient on the Internet and do their best to deliver them. Such MTAs are called open mail relays. This was very important in the early days of the Internet when network connections were unreliable.  However, this mechanism proved to be exploitable by originators of unsolicited bulk email and as a consequence open mail relays have become rare, and many MTAs do not accept messages from open mail relays.\nEmail pre-dates instant messaging, and transmission favors reliability over speed, in order to be able to cope with unreliable network links and busy servers (more common in the early days of the Internet). Reasons for slower delivery include:\n\nMessages going to a large number of recipients require more processing\nLarge messages (e.g. with large attachments) require more time to transmit over the network\nMessages need to pass through multiple servers (sometimes multiple servers inside the same organization)\nOne or more mail servers are overloaded (possibly due to spam or denial-of-service attack) and queuing incoming mail or temporarily refusing incoming connections\nSMTP requires multiple back-and-forths, which can amplify the impact of a slow network or dropped packets\nSender or recipient temporarily disconnected from the network (e.g. a laptop out of wifi range)\nSlow DNS response\nServer down for maintenance or malfunction\nMail can be queued and retried for up to five days before senders are notified of a permanent delivery failure. Messages are timestamped as they pass through each server, allowing for diagnosis of slow delivery, though analysis is complicated by time zones and computer clocks that are inaccurately set.\nEmail messages classified as spam by a spam filter may be sorted into a separate folder which the recipient must check manually, or may be dropped entirely.\n\n\n== Message format ==\nThe basic Internet message format used for email is defined by RFC 5322, with encoding of non-ASCII data and multimedia content attachments defined in RFC 2045 through RFC 2049, collectively called Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME. The extensions in International email apply only to email. RFC 5322 replaced RFC 2822 in 2008.  Earlier, in 2001, RFC 2822 had in turn replaced RFC 822, which had been the standard for Internet email for decades. Published in 1982, RFC 822 was based on the earlier RFC 733 for the ARPANET.\nInternet email messages consist of two sections, \"header\" and \"body\". These are known as \"content\".  The header is structured into fields such as From, To, CC, Subject, Date, and other information about the email. In the process of transporting email messages between systems, SMTP communicates delivery parameters and information using message header fields. The body contains the message, as unstructured text, sometimes containing a signature block at the end. The header is separated from the body by a blank line.\n\n\n=== Message header ===\nRFC 5322 specifies the syntax of the email header. Each email message has a header (the \"header section\" of the message, according to the specification), comprising a number of fields (\"header fields\"). Each field has a name (\"field name\" or \"header field name\"), followed by the separator character \":\", and a value (\"field body\" or \"header field body\").\nEach field name begins in the first character of a new line in the header section, and begins with a non-whitespace printable character. It ends with the separator character \":\". The separator is followed by the field value (the \"field body\"). The value can continue onto subsequent lines if those lines have space or tab as their first character. Field names and, without SMTPUTF8, field bodies are restricted to 7-bit ASCII characters. Some non-ASCII values may be represented using MIME encoded words.\n\n\n==== Header fields ====\nEmail header fields can be multi-line, with each line recommended to be no more than 78 characters, although the limit is 998 characters. Header fields defined by RFC 5322 contain only US-ASCII characters; for encoding characters in other sets, a syntax specified in RFC 2047 may be used. In some examples, the IETF EAI working group defines some standards track extensions, replacing previous experimental extensions so UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters may be used within the header. In particular, this allows email addresses to use non-ASCII characters. Such addresses are supported by Google and Microsoft products, and promoted by some government agents.\nThe message header must include at least the following fields:\n\nFrom: The email address, and, optionally, the name of the author(s). Some email clients are changeable through account settings.\nDate: The local time and date the message was written. Like the From: field, many email clients fill this in automatically before sending. The recipient's client may display the time in the format and time zone local to them.\nRFC 3864 describes registration procedures for message header fields at the IANA; it provides for permanent and provisional field names, including also fields defined for MIME, netnews, and HTTP, and referencing relevant RFCs. Common header fields for email include:\n\nTo: The email address(es), and optionally name(s) of the message's recipient(s). Indicates primary recipients (multiple allowed), for secondary recipients see Cc: and Bcc: below.\nSubject: A brief summary of the topic of the message. Certain abbreviations are commonly used in the subject, including \"RE:\" and \"FW:\".\nCc: Carbon copy; Many email clients mark email in one's inbox differently depending on whether they are in the To: or Cc: list.\nBcc: Blind carbon copy; addresses are usually only specified during SMTP delivery, and not usually listed in the message header.\nContent-Type: Information about how the message is to be displayed, usually a MIME type.\nPrecedence: commonly with values \"bulk\", \"junk\", or \"list\"; used to indicate automated \"vacation\" or \"out of office\" responses should not be returned for this mail, e.g. to prevent vacation notices from sent to all other subscribers of a mailing list. Sendmail uses this field to affect prioritization of queued email, with \"Precedence: special-delivery\" messages delivered sooner. With modern high-bandwidth networks, delivery priority is less of an issue than it was. Microsoft Exchange respects a fine-grained automatic response suppression mechanism, the X-Auto-Response-Suppress field.\nMessage-ID: Also an automatic-generated field to prevent multiple deliveries and for reference in In-Reply-To: (see below).\nIn-Reply-To: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to. Used to link related messages together. This field only applies to reply messages.\nList-Unsubscribe: HTTP link to unsubscribe from a mailing list.\nReferences: Message-ID of the message this is a reply to, and the message-id of the message the previous reply was a reply to, etc.\nReply-To: Address should be used to reply to the message.\nSender: Address of the sender acting on behalf of the author listed in the From: field (secretary, list manager, etc.).\nArchived-At: A direct link to the archived form of an individual email message.\nThe To: field may be unrelated to the addresses to which the message is delivered. The delivery list is supplied separately to the transport protocol, SMTP, which may be extracted from the header content. The \"To:\" field is similar to the addressing at the top of a conventional letter delivered according to the address on the outer envelope. In the same way, the \"From:\" field may not be the sender. Some mail servers apply email authentication systems to messages relayed. Data pertaining to the server's activity is also part of the header, as defined below.\nSMTP defines the trace information of a message saved in the header using the following two fields:\n\nReceived: after an SMTP server accepts a message, it inserts this trace record at the top of the header (last to first).\nReturn-Path: after the delivery SMTP server makes the final delivery of a message, it inserts this field at the top of the header.\nOther fields added on top of the header by the receiving server may be called trace fields.\n\nAuthentication-Results: after a server verifies authentication, it can save the results in this field for consumption by downstream agents.\nReceived-SPF: stores results of SPF checks in more detail than Authentication-Results.\nDKIM-Signature: stores results of DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) decryption to verify the message was not changed after it was sent.\nAuto-Submitted: is used to mark automatic-generated messages.\nVBR-Info: claims VBR whitelisting\n\n\n=== Message body ===\n\n\n==== Content encoding ====\nInternet email was designed for 7-bit ASCII. Most email software is 8-bit clean, but must assume it will communicate with 7-bit servers and mail readers. The MIME standard introduced character set specifiers and two content transfer encodings to enable transmission of non-ASCII data: quoted printable for mostly 7-bit content with a few characters outside that range and base64 for arbitrary binary data. The 8BITMIME and BINARY extensions were introduced to allow transmission of mail without the need for these encodings, but many mail transport agents may not support them. In some countries, e-mail software violates RFC 5322 by sending raw non-ASCII text and several encoding schemes co-exist; as a result, by default, the message in a non-Latin alphabet language appears in non-readable form (the only exception is a coincidence if the sender and receiver use the same encoding scheme). Therefore, for international character sets, Unicode is growing in popularity.\n\n\n==== Plain text and HTML ====\nMost modern graphic email clients allow the use of either plain text or HTML for the message body at the option of the user. HTML email messages often include an automatic-generated plain text copy for compatibility.\nAdvantages of HTML include the ability to include in-line links and images, set apart previous messages in block quotes, wrap naturally on any display, use emphasis such as underlines and italics, and change font styles. Disadvantages include the increased size of the email, privacy concerns about web bugs, abuse of HTML email as a vector for phishing attacks and the spread of malicious software.\nSome e-mail clients interpret the body as HTML even in the absence of a Content-Type: html header field; this may cause various problems.\nSome web-based mailing lists recommend all posts be made in plain text, with 72 or 80 characters per line for all the above reasons, and because they have a significant number of readers using text-based email clients such as Mutt.\nVarious informal conventions evolved for marking up plain text in email and usenet posts, which later led to the development of formal languages like setext (c. 1992) and many others, the most popular of them being markdown.\nSome Microsoft email clients may allow rich formatting using their proprietary Rich Text Format (RTF), but this should be avoided unless the recipient is guaranteed to have a compatible email client.\n\n\n== Servers and client applications ==\n\nMessages are exchanged between hosts using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol with software programs called mail transfer agents (MTAs); and delivered to a mail store by programs called mail delivery agents (MDAs, also sometimes called local delivery agents, LDAs). Accepting a message obliges an MTA to deliver it, and when a message cannot be delivered, that MTA must send a bounce message back to the sender, indicating the problem.\nUsers can retrieve their messages from servers using standard protocols such as POP or IMAP, or, as is more likely in a large corporate environment, with a proprietary protocol specific to Novell Groupwise, Lotus Notes or Microsoft Exchange Servers.  Programs used by users for retrieving, reading, and managing email are called mail user agents (MUAs).\nWhen opening an email, it is marked as \"read\", which typically visibly distinguishes it from \"unread\" messages on clients' user interfaces. Email clients may allow hiding read emails from the inbox so the user can focus on the unread.\nMail can be stored on the client, on the server side, or in both places. Standard formats for mailboxes include Maildir and mbox. Several prominent email clients use their own proprietary format and require conversion software to transfer email between them. Server-side storage is often in a proprietary format but since access is through a standard protocol such as IMAP, moving email from one server to another can be done with any MUA supporting the protocol.\nMany current email users do not run MTA, MDA or MUA programs themselves, but use a web-based email platform, such as Gmail or Yahoo! Mail, that performs the same tasks. Such webmail interfaces allow users to access their mail with any standard web browser, from any computer, rather than relying on a local email client.\n\n\n=== Filename extensions ===\nUpon reception of email messages, email client applications save messages in operating system files in the file system. Some clients save individual messages as separate files, while others use various database formats, often proprietary, for collective storage. A historical standard of storage is the mbox format. The specific format used is often indicated by special filename extensions:\n\neml\nUsed by many email clients including Novell GroupWise, Microsoft Outlook Express, Lotus notes, Windows Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Postbox. The files contain the email contents as plain text in MIME format, containing the email header and body, including attachments in one or more of several formats.\nemlx\nUsed by Apple Mail.\nmsg\nUsed by Microsoft Office Outlook and OfficeLogic Groupware.\nmbx\nUsed by Opera Mail, KMail, and Apple Mail based on the mbox format.\nSome applications (like Apple Mail) leave attachments encoded in messages for searching while also saving separate copies of the attachments. Others separate attachments from messages and save them in a specific directory.\n\n\n=== URI scheme mailto ===\n\nThe URI scheme, as registered with the IANA, defines the mailto: scheme for SMTP email addresses. Though its use is not strictly defined, URLs of this form are intended to be used to open the new message window of the user's mail client when the URL is activated, with the address as defined by the URL in the To: field. Many clients also support query string parameters for the other email fields, such as its subject line or carbon copy recipients.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Web-based email ===\n\nMany email providers have a web-based email client. This allows users to log into the email account by using any compatible web browser to send and receive their email. Mail is typically not downloaded to the web client, so it cannot be read without a current Internet connection.\n\n\n=== POP3 email servers ===\nThe Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) is a mail access protocol used by a client application to read messages from the mail server. Received messages are often deleted from the server. POP supports simple download-and-delete requirements for access to remote mailboxes (termed maildrop in the POP RFC's). POP3 allows downloading messages on a local computer and reading them even when offline.\n\n\n=== IMAP email servers ===\nThe Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) provides features to manage a mailbox from multiple devices. Small portable devices like smartphones are increasingly used to check email while traveling and to make brief replies, larger devices with better keyboard access being used to reply at greater length. IMAP shows the headers of messages, the sender and the subject and the device needs to request to download specific messages. Usually, the mail is left in folders in the mail server.\n\n\n=== MAPI email servers ===\nMessaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is used by Microsoft Outlook to communicate to Microsoft Exchange Server—and to a range of other email server products such as Axigen Mail Server, Kerio Connect, Scalix, Zimbra, HP OpenMail, IBM Lotus Notes, Zarafa, and Bynari where vendors have added MAPI support to allow their products to be accessed directly via Outlook.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\n\n=== Business and organizational use ===\nEmail has been widely accepted by businesses, governments and non-governmental organizations in the developed world, and it is one of the key parts of an 'e-revolution' in workplace communication (with the other key plank being widespread adoption of highspeed Internet). A sponsored 2010 study on workplace communication found 83% of U.S. knowledge workers felt email was critical to their success and productivity at work.\nIt has some key benefits to business and other organizations, including:\n\nFacilitating logistics\nMuch of the business world relies on communications between people who are not physically in the same building, area, or even country; setting up and attending an in-person meeting, telephone call, or conference call can be inconvenient, time-consuming, and costly. Email provides a method of exchanging information between two or more people with no set-up costs and that is generally far less expensive than a physical meeting or phone call.\nHelping with synchronization\nWith real time communication by meetings or phone calls, participants must work on the same schedule, and each participant must spend the same amount of time in the meeting or call. Email allows asynchrony: each participant may control their schedule independently. Batch processing of incoming emails can improve workflow compared to interrupting calls.\nReducing cost\nSending an email is much less expensive than sending postal mail, or long distance telephone calls, telex or telegrams.\nIncreasing speed\nMuch faster than most of the alternatives.\nCreating a \"written\" record\nUnlike a telephone or in-person conversation, email by its nature creates a detailed written record of the communication, the identity of the sender(s) and recipient(s) and the date and time the message was sent. In the event of a contract or legal dispute, saved emails can be used to prove that an individual was advised of certain issues, as each email has the date and time recorded on it.\nPossibility of auto-processing and improved distribution\nAs well pre-processing of customer's orders or addressing the person in charge can be realized by automated procedures.\n\n\n==== Email marketing ====\nEmail marketing via \"opt-in\" is often successfully used to send special sales offerings and new product information. Depending on the recipient's culture, email sent without permission—such as an \"opt-in\"—is likely to be viewed as unwelcome \"email spam\".\n\n\n=== Personal use ===\n\n\n==== Personal computer ====\nMany users access their personal emails from friends and family members using a personal computer in their house or apartment.\n\n\n==== Mobile ====\nEmail has become used on smartphones and on all types of computers. Mobile \"apps\" for email increase accessibility to the medium for users who are out of their homes. While in the earliest years of email, users could only access email on desktop computers, in the 2010s, it is possible for users to check their email when they are away from home, whether they are across town or across the world. Alerts can also be sent to the smartphone or other devices to notify them immediately of new messages. This has given email the ability to be used for more frequent communication between users and allowed them to check their email and write messages throughout the day. As of 2011, there were approximately 1.4 billion email users worldwide and 50 billion non-spam emails that were sent daily.\nIndividuals often check emails on smartphones for both personal and work-related messages. It was found that US adults check their email more than they browse the web or check their Facebook accounts, making email the most popular activity for users to do on their smartphones. 78% of the respondents in the study revealed that they check their email on their phone. It was also found that 30% of consumers use only their smartphone to check their email, and 91% were likely to check their email at least once per day on their smartphone. However, the percentage of consumers using email on a smartphone ranges and differs dramatically across different countries. For example, in comparison to 75% of those consumers in the US who used it, only 17% in India did.\n\n\n==== Declining use among young people ====\nAs of 2010, the number of Americans visiting email web sites had fallen 6 percent after peaking in November 2009. For persons 12 to 17, the number was down 18 percent. Young people preferred instant messaging, texting and social media. Technology writer Matt Richtel said in The New York Times that email was like the VCR, vinyl records and film cameras—no longer cool and something older people do.\nA 2015 survey of Android users showed that persons 13 to 24 used messaging apps 3.5 times as much as those over 45, and were far less likely to use email.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Attachment size limitation ===\n\nEmail messages may have one or more attachments, which are additional files that are appended to the email. Typical attachments include Microsoft Word documents, PDF documents, and scanned images of paper documents. In principle, there is no technical restriction on the size or number of attachments. However, in practice, email clients, servers, and Internet service providers implement various limitations on the size of files, or complete email – typically to 25MB or less. Furthermore, due to technical reasons, attachment sizes as seen by these transport systems can differ from what the user sees, which can be confusing to senders when trying to assess whether they can safely send a file by email. Where larger files need to be shared, various file hosting services are available and commonly used.\n\n\n=== Information overload ===\nThe ubiquity of email for knowledge workers and \"white collar\" employees has led to concerns that recipients face an \"information overload\" in dealing with increasing volumes of email. With the growth in mobile devices, by default employees may also receive work-related emails outside of their working day. This can lead to increased stress and decreased satisfaction with work. Some observers even argue it could have a significant negative economic effect, as efforts to read the many emails could reduce productivity.\n\n\n=== Spam ===\n\nEmail \"spam\" is unsolicited bulk email. The low cost of sending such email meant that, by 2003, up to 30% of total email traffic was spam, and was threatening the usefulness of email as a practical tool. The US CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws elsewhere had some impact, and a number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users, but the volume sent is still very high—and increasingly consists not of advertisements for products, but malicious content or links. In September 2017, for example, the proportion of spam to legitimate email rose to 59.56%. The percentage of spam email in 2021 is estimated to be 85%.\n\n\n=== Malware ===\nEmails are a major vector for the distribution of malware. This is often achieved by attaching malicious programs to the message and persuading potential victims to open the file. Types of malware distributed via email include computer worms and ransomware.\n\n\n=== Email spoofing ===\n\nEmail spoofing occurs when the email message header is designed to make the message appear to come from a known or trusted source. Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin. Email spoofing may be done as a prank, or as part of a criminal effort to defraud an individual or organization. An example of a potentially fraudulent email spoofing is if an individual creates an email that appears to be an invoice from a major company, and then sends it to one or more recipients. In some cases, these fraudulent emails incorporate the logo of the purported organization and even the email address may appear legitimate.\n\n\n=== Email bombing ===\n\nEmail bombing is the intentional sending of large volumes of messages to a target address. The overloading of the target email address can render it unusable and can even cause the mail server to crash.\n\n\n=== Privacy concerns ===\n\nToday it can be important to distinguish between the Internet and internal email systems. Internet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender's or the recipient's control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. Internal mail systems, in which the information never leaves the organizational network, may be more secure, although information technology personnel and others whose function may involve monitoring or managing may be accessing the email of other employees.\nEmail privacy, without some security precautions, can be compromised because:\n\nemail messages are generally not encrypted.\nemail messages have to go through intermediate computers before reaching their destination, meaning it is relatively easy for others to intercept and read messages.\nmany Internet Service Providers (ISP) store copies of email messages on their mail servers before they are delivered. The backups of these can remain for up to several months on their server, despite deletion from the mailbox.\nthe \"Received:\"-fields and other information in the email can often identify the sender, preventing anonymous communication.\nweb bugs invisibly embedded in HTML content can alert the sender of any email whenever an email is rendered as HTML (some e-mail clients do this when the user reads, or re-reads the e-mail) and from which IP address. It can also reveal whether an email was read on a smartphone or a PC, or Apple Mac device via the user agent string.\nThere are cryptography applications that can serve as a remedy to one or more of the above. For example, Virtual Private Networks or the Tor network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network while GPG, PGP, SMEmail, or S/MIME can be used for end-to-end message encryption, and SMTP STARTTLS or SMTP over Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.\nAdditionally, many mail user agents do not protect logins and passwords, making them easy to intercept by an attacker. Encrypted authentication schemes such as SASL prevent this. Finally, the attached files share many of the same hazards as those found in peer-to-peer filesharing. Attached files may contain trojans or viruses.\n\n\n=== Legal contracts ===\nIt is possible for an exchange of emails to form a binding contract, so users must be careful about what they send through email correspondence. A signature block on an email may be interpreted as satisfying a signature requirement for a contract.\n\n\n=== Flaming ===\nFlaming occurs when a person sends a message (or many messages) with angry or antagonistic content. The term is derived from the use of the word incendiary to describe particularly heated email discussions. The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility in person or via telephone do not exist and civility may be forgotten.\n\n\n=== Email bankruptcy ===\n\nAlso known as \"email fatigue\", email bankruptcy is when a user ignores a large number of email messages after falling behind in reading and answering them. The reason for falling behind is often due to information overload and a general sense there is so much information that it is not possible to read it all. As a solution, people occasionally send a \"boilerplate\" message explaining that their email inbox is full, and that they are in the process of clearing out all the messages. Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig is credited with coining this term, but he may only have popularized it.\n\n\n=== Internationalization ===\nOriginally Internet email was completely ASCII text-based. MIME now allows body content text and some header content text in international character sets, but other headers and email addresses using UTF-8, while standardized have yet to be widely adopted.\n\n\n=== Tracking of sent mail ===\nThe original SMTP mail service provides limited mechanisms for tracking a transmitted message, and none for verifying that it has been delivered or read. It requires that each mail server must either deliver it onward or return a failure notice (bounce message), but both software bugs and system failures can cause messages to be lost. To remedy this, the IETF introduced Delivery Status Notifications (delivery receipts) and Message Disposition Notifications (return receipts); however, these are not universally deployed in production.\nMany ISPs now deliberately disable non-delivery reports (NDRs) and delivery receipts due to the activities of spammers:\n\nDelivery Reports can be used to verify whether an address exists and if so, this indicates to a spammer that it is available to be spammed.\nIf the spammer uses a forged sender email address (email spoofing), then the innocent email address that was used can be flooded with NDRs from the many invalid email addresses the spammer may have attempted to mail. These NDRs then constitute spam (backscatter) from the ISP to the innocent user.\nIn the absence of standard methods, a range of system based around the use of web bugs have been developed. However, these are often seen as underhand or raising privacy concerns, and only work with email clients that support rendering of HTML. Many mail clients now default to not showing \"web content\". Webmail providers can also disrupt web bugs by pre-caching images.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nIANA's list of standard header fields\nThe History of Email is Dave Crocker's attempt at capturing the sequence of 'significant' occurrences in the evolution of email; a collaborative effort that also cites this page.\nThe History of Electronic Mail is a personal memoir by the implementer of an early email system\nA Look at the Origins of Network Email is a short, yet vivid recap of the key historical facts\nBusiness E-Mail Compromise - An Emerging Global Threat, FBI\nExplained from first principles, a 2021 article attempting to summarize more than 100 RFCs",

        "content": "Gmail is a mailbox provider by Google. It is the largest email service worldwide, with 1.8 billion users. It is accessible via a web browser (webmail), mobile app, or through third-party email clients via the POP and IMAP protocols. Users can also connect non-Gmail e-mail accounts to their Gmail inbox. The service was launched as Google Mail in a beta version in 2004. It came out of beta in 2009.\nThe service includes 15 gigabytes of storage for free for individual users, which includes any use by other Google services such as Google Drive and Google Photos; the limit can be increased via a paid subscription to Google One. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, and can send emails up to 25 megabytes in size. Gmail supports integration with Google Drive, allowing for larger attachments. The Gmail interface has a search engine and supports a \"conversation view\" similar to an Internet forum. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of Ajax.\nGoogle's mail servers automatically scan emails to filter spam and malware. \n\n\n== Features ==\n\n\n=== Storage ===\n\nOn April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with one gigabyte (GB) of storage space, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time.\nThe limit was doubled to two gigabytes of storage on April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail. Georges Harik, the product management director for Gmail, stated that Google would \"keep giving people more space forever.\"\nIn October 2007, Gmail increased storage to 4 gigabytes, after recent changes from competitors Yahoo and Microsoft.\nOn April 24, 2012, Google announced the increase of storage included in Gmail from 7.5 to 10 gigabytes (\"and counting\") as part of the launch of Google Drive.\nOn May 13, 2013, Google announced the overall merge of storage across Gmail, Google Drive, and Google+ Photos, allowing users 15 gigabytes of included storage among three services.\nOn August 15, 2018, Google launched Google One, a service where users can pay for additional storage, shared among Gmail, Google Drive and Google Photos, through a monthly subscription plan. As of 2021, storage of up to 15 gigabytes is included, and paid plans are available for up to 2 terabytes for personal use.\nThere are also storage limits to individual Gmail messages. Initially, one message, including all attachments, could not be larger than 25 megabytes. This was changed in March 2017 to allow receiving an email of up to 50 megabytes, while the limit for sending an email stayed at 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from Google Drive into the message.\n\n\n=== Interface ===\n\nThe Gmail user interface initially differed from other web-mail systems with its focus on search and conversation threading of emails, grouping several messages between two or more people onto a single page, an approach that was later copied by its competitors. Gmail's user interface designer, Kevin Fox, intended users to feel as if they were always on one page and just changing things on that page, rather than having to navigate to other places.\nGmail's interface also makes use of 'labels' (tags) – that replace the conventional folders and provide a more flexible method of organizing emails; filters for automatically organizing, deleting or forwarding incoming emails to other addresses; and importance markers for automatically marking messages as 'important'.\nIn November 2011, Google began rolling out a redesign of its interface that \"simplified\" the look of Gmail into a more minimalist design to provide a more consistent look throughout its products and services as part of an overall Google design change. Substantially redesigned elements included a streamlined conversation view, configurable density of information, new higher-quality themes, a resizable navigation bar with always-visible labels and contacts, and better search. Users were able to preview the new interface design for months prior to the official release, as well as revert to the old interface, until March 2012, when Google discontinued the ability to revert and completed the transition to the new design for all users.\nIn May 2013, Google updated the Gmail inbox with tabs which allow the application to categorize the user's emails. The five tabs are: Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates, and Forums. In addition to customization options, the entire update can be disabled, allowing users to return to the traditional inbox structure.\nIn April 2018, Google introduced a new web UI for Gmail. The new redesign follows Google's Material Design, and changes in the user interface include the use of Google's Product Sans font. Other updates include a Confidential mode, which allows the sender to set an expiration date for a sensitive message or to revoke it entirely, integrated rights management and two-factor authentication.\nOn 16 November 2020, Google announced new settings for smart features and personalization in Gmail. Under the new settings users were given control of their data in Gmail, Chat, and Meet, offering smart features like Smart Compose and Smart Reply.\nOn 6 April 2021, Google rolled out Google Chat and Room (early access) feature to all Gmail users.\nOn 28 July 2022, Google rolled out Material You to all Gmail users.\n\n\n=== Spam filter ===\nGmail's spam filtering features a community-driven system: when any user marks an email as spam, this provides information to help the system identify similar future messages for all Gmail users.\nIn the April 2018 update, the spam filtering banners got a redesign, with bigger and bolder lettering.\n\n\n=== Gmail Labs ===\nThe Gmail Labs feature, introduced on June 5, 2008, allows users to test new or experimental features of Gmail. Users can enable or disable Labs features selectively and provide feedback about each of them. This allows Gmail engineers to obtain user input about new features to improve them and also to assess their popularity.\nPopular features, like the \"Undo Send\" option, often \"graduate\" from Gmail Labs to become a formal setting in Gmail.\nAll Labs features are experimental and are subject to termination at any time.\n\n\n=== Search ===\nGmail incorporates a search bar for searching emails. The search bar can also search contacts, files stored in Google Drive, events from Google Calendar, and Google Sites.\nIn May 2012, Gmail improved the search functionality to include auto-complete predictions from the user's emails.\nGmail's search functionality does not support searching for word fragments (also known as 'substring search' or partial word search). Workarounds exist.\n\n\n=== Language support ===\n\nAs of March 2015, the Gmail interface supports 72 languages, including: Arabic, Basque, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (simplified), Chinese (traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English (UK), English (US), Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Gujarati, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Malay, Malayalam, Marathi, Norwegian (Bokmål), Odia, Persian, Polish, Punjabi, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog (Filipino), Tamil, Telugu, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh and Zulu.\n\n\n==== Language input styles ====\nIn October 2012, Google added over 100 virtual keyboards, transliterations, and input method editors to Gmail, enabling users different types of input styles for different languages in an effort to help users write in languages that are not \"limited by the language of your keyboard.\"\nIn October 2013, Google added handwriting input support to Gmail.\nIn August 2014, Gmail became the first major email provider to let users send and receive emails from addresses with accent marks and letters from outside the Latin alphabet.\n\n\n== Platforms ==\n\n\n=== Web browsers ===\nThe modern AJAX version is officially supported in the current and previous major releases of Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari web browsers on a rolling basis.\nGmail's \"basic HTML\" version works on almost all browsers. This version of Gmail has been discontinued from January 2024.\nIn August 2011, Google introduced Gmail Offline, an HTML5-powered app for providing access to the service while offline. Gmail Offline runs on the Google Chrome browser and can be downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.\nIn addition to the native apps on iOS and Android, users can access Gmail through the web browser on a mobile device.\n\n\n=== Mobile ===\n \nGmail has native applications for iOS devices (including iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch) and for Android devices.\nIn November 2014, Google introduced functionality in the Gmail Android app that enabled sending and receiving emails from non-Gmail addresses (such as Yahoo! Mail and Outlook.com) through POP or IMAP.\nIn November 2016, Google redesigned the Gmail app for the iOS platform, bringing the first complete visual overhaul in \"nearly four years\". The update added much more use of colors, sleeker transitions, and the addition of several \"highly-requested\" features, including Undo Send, faster search with instant results and spelling suggestions, and Swipe to Archive/Delete.\nIn May 2017, Google updated Gmail on Android to feature protection from phishing attacks. Media outlets noticed that the new protection was announced amid a widespread phishing attack on a combination of Gmail and Google's Docs document service that occurred on the same day.\nLater in May, Google announced the addition of \"Smart Reply\" to Gmail on Android and iOS. \"Smart Reply\", a feature originally launched for Google's Inbox by Gmail service, scans a message for information and uses machine intelligence to offer three responses the user can optionally edit and send. The feature is limited to the English language at launch, with additional support for Spanish, followed by other languages arriving later.\nInbox by Gmail, another app from the Gmail team, was also available for iOS and Android devices. It was discontinued in April 2019.\nThird-party programs can be used to access Gmail, using the POP or IMAP protocols. In 2019, Google rolled out dark mode for its mobile apps in Android and iOS.\n\n\n== Inbox by Gmail ==\n\nIn October 2014, Google introduced Inbox by Gmail on an invitation-only basis. Developed by the Gmail team, but serving as a \"completely different type of inbox\", the service is made to help users deal with the challenges of an active email. Citing issues such as distractions, difficulty in finding important information buried in messages, and receiving more emails than ever, Inbox by Gmail has several important differences from Gmail, including bundles that automatically sort emails of the same topic together, highlights that surface key information from messages, and reminders, assists, and snooze, that help the user in handling incoming emails at appropriate times.\nInbox by Gmail became publicly available in May 2015. In September 2018, Google announced it would end the service at the end of March 2019, most of its key features having been incorporated into the standard Gmail service. The service was discontinued on April 2, 2019.\n\n\n== Integration with Google products ==\nIn August 2010, Google released a plugin that provides integrated telephone service within Gmail's Google Chat interface. The feature initially lacked an official name, with Google referring to it as both \"Google Voice in Gmail chat\" and \"Call Phones in Gmail\". The service logged over one million calls in 24 hours. In March 2014, Google Voice was discontinued, and replaced with functionality from Google Hangouts, another communication platform from Google.\nOn February 9, 2010, Google commenced its new social networking tool, Google Buzz, which integrated with Gmail, allowing users to share links and media, as well as status updates. Google Buzz was discontinued in October 2011, replaced with new functionality in Google+, Google's then-new social networking platform.\nGmail was integrated with Google+ in December 2011, as part of an effort to have all Google information across one Google account, with a centralized Google+ user profile. Backlash from the move caused Google to step back and remove the requirement of a Google+ user account, keeping only a private Google account without a public-facing profile, starting in July 2015.\nIn May 2013, Google announced the integration between Google Wallet and Gmail, which would allow Gmail users to send money as email attachments. Although the sender must use a Gmail account, the recipient does not need to be using a Gmail address. The feature has no transaction fees, but there are limits to the amount of money that can be sent. Initially only available on the web, the feature was expanded to the Android app in March 2017, for people living in the United States.\nIn September 2016, Google released Google Trips, an app that, based on information from a user's Gmail messages, automatically generates travel cards. A travel card contains itinerary details, such as plane tickets and car rentals, and recommends activities, food and drinks, and attractions based on location, time, and interests. The app also has offline functionality. In April 2017, Google Trips received an update adding several significant features. The app now also scans Gmail for bus and train tickets, and allows users to manually input trip reservations. Users can send trip details to other users' email, and if the recipient also has Google Trips, the information will be automatically available in their apps as well.\n\n\n== Security ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nGoogle has supported the secure HTTPS since the day it launched. In the beginning, it was only default on the login page, a reason that Google engineer Ariel Rideout stated was because HTTPS made \"your mail slower\". However, users could manually switch to secure HTTPS mode inside the inbox after logging in. In July 2008, Google simplified the ability to manually enable secure mode, with a toggle in the settings menu.\nIn 2007, Google fixed a cross-site scripting security issue that could let attackers collect information from Gmail contact lists.\nIn January 2010, Google began rolling out HTTPS as the default for all users.\nIn June 2012, a new security feature was introduced to protect users from state-sponsored attacks. A banner will appear at the top of the page that warns users of an unauthorized account compromise.\nIn March 2014, Google announced that an encrypted HTTPS connection would be used for the sending and receiving of all Gmail emails, and \"every single email message you send or receive —100% of them —is encrypted while moving internally\" through the company's systems.\nWhenever possible, Gmail uses transport layer security (TLS) to automatically encrypt emails sent and received. On the web and on Android devices, users can check if a message is encrypted by checking if the message has a closed or open red padlock.\nGmail automatically scans all incoming and outgoing e-mails for viruses in email attachments. For security reasons, some file types, including executables, are not allowed to be sent in emails.\nAt the end of May 2017, Google announced that it had applied machine learning technology to identify emails with phishing and spam, having a 99.9% detection accuracy. The company also announced that Gmail would selectively delay some messages, approximately 0.05% of all, to perform more detailed analysis and aggregate details to improve its algorithms.\nIn November 2020, Google started adding click-time link protection by redirecting clicked links to Google in official Gmail clients.\n\n\n=== Third-party encryption in transit ===\n\nIn Google's Transparency Report under the Safer email section, it provides information on the percentage of emails encrypted in transit between Gmail and third-party email providers.\n\n\n=== Two-step verification ===\nGmail supports two-step verification, an optional additional measure for users to protect their accounts when logging in.\nOnce enabled, users are required to verify their identity using a second method after entering their username and password when logging in on a new device. Common methods include entering a code sent to a user's mobile phone through a text message, entering a code using the Google Authenticator smartphone app, responding to a prompt on an Android/iOS device  or by inserting a physical security key into the computer's USB port.\nUsing a security key for two-step verification was made available as an option in October 2014.\n\n\n=== 24-hour lockdowns ===\nIf an algorithm detects what Google calls \"abnormal usage that may indicate that your account has been compromised\", the account can be automatically locked down for between one minute and 24 hours, depending on the type of activity detected. Listed reasons for a lock-down include:\n\nReceiving, deleting, or downloading large amounts of mail from POP/IMAP client within a short period of time.\nSending a large number of messages which fail to deliver.\nUsing software which automatically logs into one's account.\nLeaving multiple instances of Gmail open.\n\n\n=== Anti-child pornography policy ===\nGoogle combats child pornography through Gmail's servers in conjunction with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) to find children suffering abuse around the world. In collaboration with the NCMEC, Google creates a database of child pornography pictures. Each one of the images is given a unique numerical number known as a hash. Google then scans Gmail looking for the unique hashes. When suspicious images are located Google reports the incident to the appropriate national authorities.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe idea for Gmail was developed by Paul Buchheit several years before it was announced to the public. The project was known by the code name Caribou. During early development, the project was kept secret from most of Google's own engineers. This changed once the project improved, and by early 2004, most employees were using it to access the company's internal email system.\nGmail was announced to the public by Google on April 1, 2004, as a limited beta release.\nIn November 2006, Google began offering a Java-based application of Gmail for mobile phones.\nIn October 2007, Google began a process of rewriting parts of the code that Gmail used, which would make the service faster and add new features, such as custom keyboard shortcuts and the ability to bookmark specific messages and email searches. Gmail also added IMAP support in October 2007.\nAn update around January 2008 changed elements of Gmail's use of JavaScript, and resulted in the failure of a third-party script some users had been using. Google acknowledged the issue and helped users with workarounds.\nGmail exited the beta status on July 7, 2009.\nPrior to December 2013, users had to approve to see images in emails, which acted as a security measure. This changed in December 2013, when Google, citing improved image handling, enabled images to be visible without user approval. Images are now routed through Google's secure proxy servers rather than the original external host servers. MarketingLand noted that the change to image handling means email marketers will no longer be able to track the recipient's IP address or information about what kind of device the recipient is using. However, Wired stated that the new change means senders can track the time when an email is first opened, as the initial loading of the images requires the system to make a \"callback\" to the original server.\n\n\n=== Growth ===\nIn June 2012, Google announced that Gmail had 425 million active users globally. In May 2015, Google announced that Gmail had 900 million active users, 75% of whom were using the service on mobile devices. In February 2016, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1 billion active users. In July 2017, Google announced that Gmail had passed 1.2 billion active users.\nIn the business sector, Quartz reported in August 2014 that, among 150 companies checked in three major categories in the United States (Fortune 50 largest companies, mid-size tech and media companies, and startup companies from the last Y Combinator incubator class), only one Fortune 50 company used Gmail – Google itself – while 60% of mid-sized companies and 92% of startup companies were using Gmail.\nIn May 2014, Gmail became the first app on the Google Play Store to hit one billion installations on Android devices.\n\n\n=== Gamil Design company and misspellings ===\nBefore the introduction of Gmail, the website of product and graphic design from Gamil Design in Raleigh, North Carolina, received 3,000 hits per month. In May 2004, a Google engineer who had accidentally gone to the Gamil site a number of times contacted the company and asked if the site had experienced an increase in traffic. In fact, the site's activity had doubled. Two years later, with 600,000 hits per month, the Internet service provider wanted to charge more, and Gamil posted the message on its site \"You may have arrived here by misspelling Gmail. We understand. Typing fast is not our strongest skill. But since you've typed your way here, let's share.\"\n\n\n== Google Workspace ==\n\nAs part of Google Workspace (formerly G Suite), Google's business-focused offering, Gmail comes with additional features, including:\n\nEmail addresses with the customer's domain name (@yourcompany.com)\n99.9% guaranteed uptime with zero scheduled downtime for maintenance\nEither 30 GB or unlimited storage shared with Google Drive, depending on the plan\n24/7 phone and email support\nSynchronization compatibility with Microsoft Outlook and other email providers\nSupport for add-ons that integrate third-party apps purchased from the Google Workspace Marketplace with Gmail\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Privacy ===\n\nGoogle has one privacy policy that covers all of its services.\nGoogle claims that they \"will not target ads based on sensitive information, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or sensitive financial categories.\"\n\n\n=== Automated scanning of email content ===\nGoogle's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including filtering spam and malware, and (until 2017) adding context-sensitive advertisements next to emails.\nPrivacy advocates raised concerns about this practice; concerns included that allowing email content to be read by a machine (as opposed to a person) can allow Google to keep unlimited amounts of information forever; the automated background scanning of data raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email usage will be reduced or eroded; information collected from emails could be retained by Google for years after its current relevancy to build complete profiles on users; emails sent by users from other email providers get scanned despite never having agreed to Google's privacy policy or terms of service; Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally, and for minor changes to the policy it can do so without informing users; in court cases, governments and organizations can potentially find it easier to legally monitor email communications; at any time, Google can change its current company policies to allow combining information from emails with data gathered from use of its other services; and any internal security problem on Google's systems can potentially expose many – or all – of its users.\nIn 2004, thirty-one privacy and civil liberties organizations wrote a letter calling upon Google to suspend its Gmail service until the privacy issues were adequately addressed. The letter also called upon Google to clarify its written information policies regarding data retention and data sharing among its business units. The organizations also voiced their concerns about Google's plan to scan the text of all incoming messages for the purposes of ad placement, noting that the scanning of confidential email for inserting third-party ad content violates the implicit trust of an email service provider.\nOn June 23, 2017, Google announced that, later in 2017, it would phase out the scanning of email content to generate contextual advertising, relying on personal data collected through other Google services instead. The company stated that this change was meant to clarify its practices and quell concerns among enterprise G Suite (now Google Workspace) customers who felt an ambiguous distinction between the free consumer and paid professional variants, the latter being advertising-free.\n\n\n=== Lawsuits ===\nIn March 2011, a former Gmail user in Texas sued Google, claiming that its Gmail service violates users' privacy by scanning e-mail messages to serve relevant ads.\nIn July 2012, some California residents filed two class action lawsuits against Google and Yahoo!, claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non-Gmail or non-Yahoo! email users to Gmail and Yahoo! recipients without the senders' knowledge, consent or permission. A motion filed by Google's attorneys in the case concedes that Gmail users have \"no expectation of privacy\".\n\nA court filing uncovered by advocacy group Consumer Watchdog in August 2013 revealed that Google stated in a court filing that no \"reasonable expectation\" exists among Gmail users in regard to the assured confidentiality of their emails. In response to a lawsuit filed in May 2013, Google explained:\"All users of email must necessarily expect that their emails will be subject to automated processing. Just as a sender of a letter to a business colleague cannot be surprised that the recipient's assistant opens the letter, people who use web-based email today cannot be surprised if their communications are processed by the recipient's ECS [electronic communications service] provider in the course of delivery.A Google spokesperson stated to the media on August 15, 2013, that the corporation takes the privacy and security concerns of Gmail users \"very seriously\".\n\n\n=== April 2014 Terms of service update ===\nGoogle updated its terms of service for Gmail in April 2014 to create full transparency for its users in regard to the scanning of email content. The relevant revision states: \"Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection. This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.\" A Google spokesperson explained that the corporation wishes for its policies \"to be simple and easy for users to understand.\"\nIn response to the update, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, stated: \"The really dangerous things that Google is doing are things like the information held in Analytics, cookies in advertising and the profiling that it is able to do on individual accounts\".\n\n\n=== Microsoft ad campaign against Google ===\nIn 2013, Microsoft launched an advertising campaign to attack Google for scanning email messages, arguing that most consumers are not aware that Google monitors their personal messages to deliver targeted ads. Microsoft claims that its email service Outlook does not scan the contents of messages and a Microsoft spokesperson called the issue of privacy \"Google's kryptonite\". In response, Google stated; \"We work hard to make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive and relevant ... No humans read your e-mail or Google Account information in order to show you advertisements or related information. An automated algorithm — similar to that used for features like Priority Inbox or spam filtering — determines which ads are shown.\" The New York Times cites \"Google supporters\", who say that \"Microsoft's ads are distasteful, the last resort of a company that has been unsuccessful at competing against Google on the more noble battleground of products\".\n\n\n=== Other privacy issues ===\n\n\n==== 2010 attack from China ====\nIn January 2010, Google detected a \"highly sophisticated\" cyberattack on its infrastructure that originated from China. The targets of the attack were Chinese human rights activists, but Google discovered that accounts belonging to European, American and Chinese activists for human rights in China had been \"routinely accessed by third parties\". Additionally, Google stated that their investigation revealed that \"at least\" 20 other large companies from a \"wide range of businesses\" - including the Internet, finance, technology, media and chemical sectors – had been similarly targeted. Google was in the process of notifying those companies and it had also worked with relevant US authorities. In light of the attacks, Google enhanced the security and architecture of its infrastructure, and advised individual users to install anti-virus and anti-spyware on their computers, update their operating systems and web browsers, and be cautious when clicking on Internet links or when sharing personal information in instant messages and emails.\n\n\n==== Social network integration ====\nThe February 2010 launch of Google Buzz, a now defunct social network linked to Gmail, immediately drew criticism for publicly sharing details of users' contacts unless the default settings were changed. A new Gmail feature was launched in January 2014, whereby users could email people with Google+ accounts even though they do not know the email address of the recipient. Marc Rotenberg, President of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the feature \"troubling\", and compared it to the initial privacy flaw of Google Buzz's launch.\n\n\n==== Update to DoubleClick privacy policy ====\nIn June 2016, Julia Angwin of ProPublica wrote about Google's updated privacy policy, which deleted a clause that had stated Google would not combine DoubleClick web browsing cookie information with personally identifiable information from its other services. This change has allowed Google to merge users' personally identifiable information from different Google services to create one unified ad profile for each user. After publication of the article, Google reached out to ProPublica to say that the merge would not include Gmail keywords in ad targeting.\n\n\n=== Outages ===\nGmail suffered at least seven outages in 2009, causing doubts about the reliability of its service. It suffered a new outage on February 28, 2011, in which a bug caused Gmail accounts to seem empty. Google stated in a blog post that \"email was never lost\" and restoration was in progress. Other outages occurred on April 17, 2012, September 24, 2013, January 24, 2014, January 29, 2019  and August 20, 2020.\nGoogle has stated that \"Gmail remains more than 99.9% available to all users, and we're committed to keeping events like [the 2009 outage] notable for their rarity.\"\n\n\n=== \"On behalf of\" tag ===\nIn May 2009, Farhad Manjoo wrote on The New York Times blog about Gmail's \"on behalf of\" tag. Manjoo explained: \"The problems [sic] is, when you try to send outbound mail from your Gmail universal inbox, Gmail adds a tag telling your recipients that you're actually using Gmail and not your office e-mail. If your recipient is using Microsoft Outlook, he'll see a message like, 'From youroffice@domain.com on behalf of yourgmail@gmail.com.'\" Manjoo further wrote that \"Google explains that it adds the tag in order to prevent your e-mail from being considered spam by your recipient; the theory is that if the e-mail is honest about its origins, it shouldn't arouse suspicion by spam checking software\". The following July, Google announced a new option that would remove the \"On behalf of\" tag, by sending the email from the server of the other email address instead of using Gmail's servers.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nComparison of mail servers\nComparison of webmail providers\nList of Google products\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website \nOfficial Website for Gmail for Work\nGmail official mobile site (multi-language)",

        "content": "Online chat is any direct text-, audio- or video-based (webcams), one-on-one or one-to-many (group) chat (formally also known as synchronous conferencing), using tools such as instant messengers, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), talkers and possibly MUDs or other online games. Online chat includes web-based applications that allow communication – often directly addressed, but anonymous between users in a multi-user environment. Web conferencing is a more specific online service, that is often sold as a service, hosted on a web server controlled by the vendor. Online chat may address point-to-point communications as well as multicast communications from one sender to multiple receivers and voice and video chat, or may be a feature of a web conferencing service.\nOnline chat in a narrower sense is any kind of communication over the Internet that offers a real-time transmission of text messages from sender to receiver. Chat messages are generally short in order to enable other participants to respond quickly. Thereby, a feeling similar to a spoken conversation is created, which distinguishes chatting from other text-based online communication forms such as Internet forums and email. The expression online chat comes from the word chat which means \"informal conversation\".\nSynchronous conferencing or synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC) is any form of computer-mediated communication that occurs in real-time; that is, there is no significant delay between sending and receiving messages. SCMC includes real-time forms of text, audio, and video communication. SCMC has been highly studied in the context of e-learning.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first online chat system was called Talkomatic, created by Doug Brown and David R. Woolley in 1973 on the PLATO System at the University of Illinois. It offered several channels, each of which could accommodate up to five people, with messages appearing on all users' screens character-by-character as they were typed. Talkomatic was popular among PLATO users into the mid-1980s. In 2014, Brown and Woolley released a web-based version of Talkomatic.\nThe first online system to use the actual command \"chat\" was created for The Source in 1979 by Tom Walker and Fritz Thane of Dialcom, Inc.\nOther chat platforms flourished during the 1980s. Among the earliest with a GUI was BroadCast, a Macintosh extension that became especially popular on university campuses in America and Germany.\nThe first transatlantic Internet chat took place between Oulu, Finland and Corvallis, Oregon in February 1989.\nThe first dedicated online chat service that was widely available to the public was the CompuServe CB Simulator in 1980, created by CompuServe executive Alexander \"Sandy\" Trevor in Columbus, Ohio. Ancestors include network chat software such as UNIX \"talk\" used in the 1970s.\nChat is implemented in multiple video-conferencing tools. A study of chat use during work-related videoconferencing found that chat during meetings allows participants to communicate without interrupting the meeting, plan action around common resources, and enables greater inclusion. The study also found that chat can cause distractions and information asymmetries between participants.\n\n\n== Types ==\nAccording to the type of media used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into\n\naudio conferencing: only audio is used\nvideo conferencing: Both audio (voice) and video and pictures are used.\nAccording to the number of access point used, synchronous conferencing can be divided into \n\npoint-to-point: Only two computers are connected end to end.\nmulti-point: Two or more than two computers are connected.\n\n\n== Methods ==\nSome of the methods used in synchronous conferencing are:\n\nChat (text only): Multiple participants can be logged into the conference and can interactively share resources and ideas. There is also an option to save the chat and archive it for later review.\nVoice (telephone or voice-over IP): This is a conference call between the instructor and the participating students where they can speak through a built-in microphone or a headset.\nVideo conferencing: This may or may not require the participants to have their webcams running. Usually, a video conference involves a live feed from a classroom or elsewhere or content.\nWeb conferencing: This includes Webinar (Web-based seminar) as well. Unlike in video conferencing, participants of web conferencing can access a wider variety of media elements. Web conferences are comparatively more interactive and usually incorporate chat sessions as well.\nVirtual worlds: In this setup, students can meet in the virtual world and speak with each other through headsets and VoIP. \tThis can make learning more productive and engaging when the students can navigate the worlds and operate in their avatar.\n\n\n== Synchronous vs asynchronous conferencing ==\nBoth synchronous and asynchronous conferencing are online conferencing where the participants can interact while being physically located at different places in the world. Asynchronous conferencing allows the students to access the learning material at their convenience while synchronous conferencing requires that all participants including the instructor and the students be online at the time of the conference.\nWhile synchronous conferencing enables real-time interaction of the participants, asynchronous conferencing allows participants to post messages and others can respond to it at any convenient time. Sometimes a combination of both synchronous and asynchronous conferencing is used. Both methods give a permanent record of the conference.\n\n\n== Critical factors for effective implementation ==\nThere are four critical factors identified for implementing synchronous conferencing for effective instruction to the students\n\nVideo and audio quality which depends on technical factors like higher bandwidth and processing capabilities of the system.\nTraining time depends on the familiarity and proficiency of the instructors and the students with the technology.\nTeaching strategies depend on the adaptability of the instructors to the new methods, preparing appropriate and effective training materials, and motivating students.\nDirect meeting of the instructor and the students.\n\n\n== Synchronous conferencing in higher education ==\nSynchronous conferencing in education helps in the delivery of content through digital media. Since this is real-time teaching, it also brings the benefits of face-to-face teaching in distance learning. Multiple higher education institutions offer well-designed quality e-learning opportunities. \nSome of the advantages of synchronous conferencing in education are:\n\nHelps the students to connect with not only their teachers and peers but also with recognized experts in the field regardless of the geographical distance and different time zones.\nProvides opportunities for both the teachers and the students to expand their knowledge outside the classroom.\nHelps students who are home-bound or limited mobility to connect with their classrooms and participate in learning.\nHelps the faculties to conduct classes when they are not able to come to classes due to an emergency.\nSupports real-time collaboration, interaction, and immediate feedback\nEncourage students to learn together and in turn, develop cultural understanding\nPersonalized learning experience for the students\nReal-time discussion opportunities for students promoting student engagement\nActive interaction can lead to an associated community of like-minded students\nSaves travel expenses and time\n\n\n== Implementation of educational technology ==\nThe tools for implementing synchronous conferencing depend on the type of educational problem addressed. This is in turn decides the method of synchronous conferencing to be used and the tool to be used in the learning context. The tool selected addresses the problem of improving the learning outcomes which cannot be solved with an asynchronous environment. There are a number of tools and platforms available for synchronous conferencing.\n\nSmartphone applications\nWeb conferencing tools\nVideo conferencing tools\nVideo and hangout platforms\nShared whiteboards\nThe selection of tools and platforms also depends on the group size which depends on the activity for the course design.\n\n\n== Chatiquette ==\nThe term chatiquette (chat etiquette) is a variation of netiquette (Internet etiquette) and describes basic rules of online communication. These conventions or guidelines have been created to avoid misunderstandings and to simplify the communication between users. Chatiquette varies from community to community and generally describes basic courtesy. As an example, it is considered rude to write only in upper case, because it appears as if the user is shouting. The word \"chatiquette\" has been used in connection with various chat systems (e.g. Internet Relay Chat) since 1995.\nChatrooms can produce a strong sense of online identity leading to impression of subculture.\nChats are valuable sources of various types of information, the automatic processing of which is the object of chat/text mining technologies.\n\n\n== Limitations ==\nSome limitations for synchronous conferencing in learning are:\n\nDisjointed discussions, not connected in time\nLack of effective moderation and/or clear guidelines for learners\nDifficulty in collaborating on online projects\nLack of proper communication with the instructor and students.\nTechnical issues may arise if not analysed and planned in advance\nLack of familiarity with the tools\nLimited time to complete the learning activity and to incorporate interactions with the learners\n\n\n== Social criticism ==\nCriticism of online chatting and text messaging include concern that they replace proper English with shorthand or with an almost completely new hybrid language.\nWriting is changing as it takes on some of the functions and features of speech. Internet chat rooms and rapid real-time teleconferencing allow users to interact with whoever happens to coexist in cyberspace. These virtual interactions involve us in 'talking' more freely and more widely than ever before. With chatrooms replacing multiple face-to-face conversations, it is necessary to be able to have quick conversation as if the person were present, so some learn to type as quickly as they would normally speak. Some critics are wary that this casual form of speech is being used so much that it will slowly take over common grammar; however, such a change has yet to be seen.\n\nWith the increasing population of online chatrooms there has been a massive growth of new words created or slang words, a number of them documented on the website Urban Dictionary. Sven Birkerts wrote:\n\"as new electronic modes of communication provoke similar anxieties amongst critics who express concern that young people are at risk, endangered by a rising tide of information over which the traditional controls of print media and the guardians of knowledge have no control on it\".\nIn Guy Merchant's journal article Teenagers in Cyberspace: An Investigation of Language Use and Language Change in Internet Chatrooms; Merchant says\n\"that teenagers and young people are in the leading the movement of change as they take advantage of the possibilities of digital technology, drastically changing the face of literacy in a variety of media through their uses of mobile phone text messages, e-mails, web-pages and on-line chatrooms. This new literacy develops skills that may well be important to the labor market but are currently viewed with suspicion in the media and by educationalists.  Merchant also says \"Younger people tend to be more adaptable than other sectors of society and, in general, quicker to adapt to new technology. To some extent they are the innovators, the forces of change in the new communication landscape.\" In this article he is saying that young people are merely adapting to what they were given.\n\n\n== Synchronous conferencing protocols ==\nSynchronous conferencing protocols include:\n\nIRC (Internet Relay Chat)\nPSYC (Protocol for Synchronous Conferencing)\nSILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing protocol)\nXMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)\nSIMPLE (instant messaging protocol) (Session Initiation Protocol for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions)\n\n\n== Software and protocols ==\nThe following are common chat programs and protocols:\n\nChat programs supporting multiple protocols:\n\nWeb sites with browser-based chat services:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAsynchronous conferencing\nChat room\nCollaborative software\nInstant messaging\nInternet forum\nMUDs (Multi-User Dungeons)\nOnline dating service\nReal-time text\nVideotelephony\nVoice chat\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "An issue tracking system (also ITS, trouble ticket system, support ticket, request management or incident ticket system) is a computer software package that manages and maintains lists of issues. Issue tracking systems are generally used in collaborative settings, especially in large or distributed collaborations, but can also be employed by individuals as part of a time management or personal productivity regimen. These systems often encompass resource allocation, time accounting, priority management, and oversight workflow in addition to implementing a centralized issue registry.\n\n\n== Background ==\nIn the institutional setting, issue tracking systems are commonly used in an organization's customer support call center to create, update, and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that organization's other employees. A support ticket should include vital information for the account involved and the issue encountered. An issue tracking system often also contains a knowledge base containing information on each customer, resolutions to common problems, and other such data.\nAn issue tracking system is similar to a \"bugtracker\", and often, a software company will sell both, and some bugtrackers are capable of being used as an issue tracking system, and vice versa. Consistent use of an issue or bug tracking system is considered one of the \"hallmarks of a good software team\".\nA ticket element, within an issue tracking system, is a running report on a particular problem, its status, and other relevant data. They are commonly created in a help desk or call center environment and almost always have a unique reference number, also known as a case, issue or call log number which is used to allow the user or help staff to quickly locate, add to or communicate the status of the user's issue or request.\nThese tickets are called so because of their origin as small cards within a traditional wall mounted work planning system when this kind of support started. Operators or staff receiving a call or query from a user would fill out a small card with the user's details and a brief summary of the request and place it into a position (usually the last) in a column of pending slots for an appropriate engineer, so determining the staff member who would deal with the query and the priority of the request.\nThe shared conceptual foundation between issue tracking systems and bugtrackers is that a valid issue must be amenable to a decisive resolution (such as \"completed\", \"fixed\", or a group consensus that the issue is not worth solving, such as \"not a problem\" or \"won't fix\"); that each issue is unique (duplicate problem reports are in most cases promptly amalgamated into a single active issue or ticket); and—beyond the screening stage—that there is precisely one person assigned formal responsibility to move the issue forward (this formal baton will often bounce around many times as the issue evolves). In bug trackers, issues are generally quality or feature related with respect to a codebase (which is inherently a project management setting) whereas in generalized issue tracking systems, the tickets are often service-related or relationship-based, with closer ties to customer relationship management (CRM) concerns.\n\n\n== Issues ==\nIssues can have several aspects to them. Each issue in the system may have an urgency value assigned to it, based on the overall importance of that issue. Low or zero urgency issues are minor and should be resolved as time permits.\nOther details of issues include the customer experiencing the issue (whether external or internal), date of submission, detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information. Each issue maintains a history of each change.\n\n\n== Functions ==\nIssue-tracking systems fulfill different functions, in particular:\n\nEntering of dysfunctions, errors and requests (e.g. manually or by e-mail Response Management Systems)\nDistribution and assignment of issues to persons in charge\nMonitoring of handling, time spent and quality of work\nEnsuring the observation of internal processes by forced control with help of workflows\nStatistical analysis of the number of tickets\nAutomatic generation of tickets by alarming systems, e.g. network monitoring\nFulfillment of external service agreements (Service Level Agreement, SLA)\nSystematic collection of questions and answers for FAQs\nAssignment of a priority to each issue based on the overall importance of that issue, the customer, date of submission, SLA\nContaining a detailed descriptions of the problem being experienced, attempted solutions or workarounds, and other relevant information\nMaintaining of a history of each change\n\n\n== Workflow ==\nAn example scenario is presented to demonstrate how a common issue tracking system would work:\n\nA customer service technician receives a telephone call, email, or other communication from a customer about a problem. Some applications provide built-in messaging system and automatic error reporting from exception handling blocks.\nThe technician verifies that the problem is real, and not just perceived. The technician will also ensure that enough information about the problem is obtained from the customer. This information generally includes the environment of the customer, when and how the issue occurs, and all other relevant circumstances.\nThe technician creates the issue in the system, entering all relevant data, as provided by the customer.\nAs work is done on that issue, the system is updated with new data by the technician. Any attempt at fixing the problem should be noted in the issue system. Ticket status most likely will be changed from open to pending.\nAfter the issue has been fully addressed, it is marked as resolved in the issue tracking system.\nIf the problem is not fully resolved, the ticket will be reopened once the technician receives new information from the customer.\nA Run Book Automation process that implements best practices for these workflows and increases IT personnel effectiveness is becoming very common.\n\n\n== Use in different sectors ==\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nSome government services use issue tracking system to keep track of issues and display them to the public. Issue tracking systems may show all tasks still to be done by the government (in a waiting queue), finished tasks, tasks in progress, order sequence, etc. Finished tasks can also be foreseen with the report, showing what exactly has been done on the issue.\nIssue tracking systems are for instance used to track which legislative bills are up for voting and the outcome of them.\nTransport and infrastructure issues (i.e. obstructions on roads, complains, ...) can also be filed using issue tracking systems. The issues can then be tackled by the relevant government services.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHelp desk software\nComparison of help desk issue tracking software\nComparison of issue-tracking systems\nClimate Action Tracker\nGovernment by algorithm\nIssue log\nNational Priorities List\nSuggestion box\nOpen-source software development\nPrioritization\nPush–pull strategy\nResource allocation\nUser innovation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n: This category has a misleading name as it lists both bug and issue tracking systems.\n: Helpdesk & issue tracking software at DMOZ\n: This category lists issue tracking systems developed in Java.",

        "content": "Airline reservation systems (ARS) are systems that allow an airline to sell their inventory (seats). It contains information on schedules and fares and contains a database of reservations (or passenger name records) and of tickets issued (if applicable). ARSs are part of passenger service systems (PSS), which are applications supporting the direct contact with the passenger.\nARS eventually evolved into the computer reservations system (CRS). A computer reservation system is used for the reservations of a particular airline and interfaces with a global distribution system (GDS) which supports travel agencies and other distribution channels in making reservations for most major airlines in a single system.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAirline reservation systems incorporate airline schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations and ticket records. An airline's direct distribution works within their own reservation system, as well as pushing out information to the GDS. The second type of direct distribution channel are consumers who use the internet or mobile applications to make their own reservations. Travel agencies and other indirect distribution channels access the same GDS as those accessed by the airline reservation systems, and all messaging is transmitted by a standardized messaging system that functions on two types of messaging that transmit on SITA's high level network (HLN). These messaging types are called Type A [usually EDIFACT format] for real time interactive communication and Type B [TTY] for informational and booking type of messages. Message construction standards set by IATA and ICAO, are global, and apply to more than air transportation. Since airline reservation systems are business critical applications, and they are functionally quite complex, the operation of an in-house airline reservation system is relatively expensive.\nPrior to deregulation, airlines owned their own reservation systems with travel agents subscribing to them. Today, the GDS are run by independent companies with airlines and travel agencies being major subscribers.\nAs of February 2009, there are only a few major GDS providers in the market: Amadeus, Travelport (which operates the Apollo, Worldspan and Galileo systems), Sabre, InteliSys Aviation (which owns ameliaRES PSS) and Shares. There is one major Regional GDS, Abacus, serving the Asian market and a number of regional players serving single countries, including Travelsky (China), ORS (Russia), Infini and Axess (both Japan) and Topas (South Korea).  Of these, Infini is hosted within the Sabre complex, Axess is in the process of moving into a partition within the Worldspan complex, and Topas agencies will be migrating into Amadeus.\nReservation systems may host \"ticket-less\" airlines and \"hybrid\" airlines that use e-ticketing in addition to ticket-less to accommodate code-shares and interlines.\nIn addition to these \"standardized\" GDS, some airlines have proprietary versions which they use to run their flight operations. A few examples are Delta's OSS and Deltamatic systems and EDS SHARES.  SITA Reservations remains the largest neutral multi-host airline reservations system, with over 100 airlines currently managing inventory.\n\n\n== Inventory management ==\nIn the airline industry, available seats are commonly referred to as inventory. The inventory of an airline is generally classified into service classes (e.g. economy,  premium economy, business or first class) and any number of fare classes, to which different prices and booking conditions may apply. Fare classes are complicated and vary from airline to airline, often indicated by a one letter code. The meaning of these codes are not often known by the passenger, but conveys information to airline staff, for example they may indicate that a ticket was fully paid, or discounted or purchased through a loyalty scheme, etc. Some seats may not be available for open sale, but reserved for example for connecting flight or loyalty scheme passengers. Overbooking is also a common practice, and is an exception to inventory management principles. One of the core functions of inventory management is inventory control. Inventory control monitors how many seats are available in the different fare classes, and by opening and closing individual fare classes for sale.\nA flight schedule management system forms the foundation of the inventory management system. Besides other functions, it is critical for ticket sales, crew member assignments, aircraft maintenance, airport coordination, and connections to partner airlines. The schedule system monitors what and when aircraft will be available on particular routes, and their internal configuration. Inventory data is imported and maintained from the schedule distribution system. Changes to aircraft availability would immediately impact the available seats of the fleet, as well as the seats which had been sold.\nThe price for each sold seat is determined by a combination of the fares and booking conditions stored in the Fare Quote System,. In most cases, inventory control has a real time interface to an airline's yield management system to support a permanent optimization of the offered booking classes in response to changes in demand or pricing strategies of competitors.\n\n\n== Availability display and reservation (PNR) ==\nUsers access an airline's inventory through an availability display. It contains all offered flights for a particular city-pair with their available seats in the different booking classes. This display contains flights which are operated by the airline itself as well as code share flights which are operated in co-operation with another airline. If the city pair is not one on which the airline offers service, it may display a connection using its own flights or display the flights of other airlines. The availability of seats of other airlines is updated through standard industry interfaces. Depending on the type of co-operation, it supports access to the last seat (last seat availability) in real-time. Reservations for individual passengers or groups are stored in a so-called passenger name record (PNR). Among other data, the PNR contains personal information such as name, contact information or special services requests (SSRs) e.g. for a vegetarian meal, as well as the flights (segments) and issued tickets. Some reservation systems also allow to store customer data in profiles to avoid data re-entry each time a new reservation is made for a known passenger. In addition, most systems have interfaces to CRM systems or customer loyalty applications (aka frequent traveler systems). Before a flight departs, the so-called passenger name list (PNL) is handed over to the departure control system that is used to check-in passengers and baggage. Reservation data such as the number of booked passengers and special service requests is also transferred to flight operations systems, crew management and catering systems. Once a flight has departed, the reservation system is updated with a list of the checked-in passengers (e.g. passengers who had a reservation but did not check in (no shows) and passengers who checked in, but did not have a reservation (go shows)). Finally, data needed for revenue accounting and reporting is handed over to administrative systems.\n\n\n== Fare quote and ticketing ==\n\nThe Fares data store contains fare tariffs, rule sets, routing maps, class of service tables, and some tax information that construct the price – \"the fare\". Rules like booking conditions (e.g. minimum stay, advance purchase, etc.) are tailored differently between different city pairs or zones, and assigned a class of service corresponding to its appropriate inventory bucket. Inventory control can also be manipulated manually through the availability feeds, dynamically controlling how many seats are offered for a particular price by opening and closing particular classes.\nThe compiled set of fare conditions is called a fare basis code. There are two systems set up for the interchange of fares data — ATPCO and SITA, plus some system to system direct connects. This system distributes the fare tariffs and rule sets to all GDSs and other subscribers. Every airline employs staff who code air fare rules in accordance with yield management intent. There are also revenue managers who watch fares as they are filed into the public tariffs and make competitive recommendations. Inventory control is typically manipulated from here, using availability feeds to open and close classes of service.\nThe role of the ticketing complex is to issue and store electronic ticket records and the very small number of paper tickets that are still issued. Miscellaneous charges order (MCO) is still a paper document; IATA has working groups defining the replacement document the electronic multipurpose document (EMD) as at 2010. The electronic ticket information is stored in a database containing the data that historically was printed on a paper ticket including items such as the ticket number, the fare and tax components of the ticket price or exchange rate information. In the past, airlines issued paper tickets; since 2008, IATA has been supporting a resolution to move to 100% electronic ticketing. So far, the industry has not been able to comply due to various technological and international limitations. The industry is at 98% electronic ticket issuance today, although electronic processing for MCOs was not available in time for the IATA mandate.\n\n\n== Notable systems ==\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAmerican Airlines and Teleregister Company developed a number of automated airline booking systems known as Reservisor. it first version was an electromechanical version of the flight boards introduced for the \"sell and report\" system that was installed in American's Boston reservation office in February 1946. These simple vacuum tube and electromechanical computers were based on telephone switching systems made by Teleregister. \nIn the late 1950s, the American Airles wanted a system that would allow real-time access to flight details in all of its offices, and the integration and automation of its booking and ticketing processes. It introduced an electronic reservations system, Magnetronic Reservisor, in 1952. \nThe first computerized booking system was the little-known Trans-Canada Air Lines (today's Air Canada) system, ReserVec developed by Ferranti Canada . It started to be delivered in April 1961 and by January 24, 1963 completed the airline switch-over from the manual systems. InteliSys Aviation in Canada continues this tradition of innovation with the first 100% cloud-based Passenger Service System.\nShortly after, in 1962 another computerized reservation system began to be delivered to United Airlines which was one of the largest computer systems at that time, controlling 60 cities in a communication system that provided one second response time. Developed by Evelyn Berezin at the Teleregister Company, it was an update to the era of the transistor of its line of Reservisor systems making them now fully electronic.\nIn 1964, American Airlines developed SABRE (Semi-Automated Business Research Environment) using IBM hardware. What made SABRE revolutionary was that it enabled American Airlines sales agents around the world to view seat inventory and book tickets in real time.  SABRE reduced a process which formerly took 90 minutes on average to a few seconds.  However, for its first decade, SABRE could be accessed directly only by American Airlines employees at American Airlines offices.  It was opened to outside travel agents in 1976, as part of the larger evolution of the ARS into the CRS and ultimately the GDS. \nThe deregulation of the airline industry, in the Airline Deregulation Act, meant that airlines, which had previously operated under government-set fares ensuring airlines at least broke even, now needed to improve efficiency to compete in a free market.  In this deregulated environment, the ARS and its descendants became vital to the travel industry.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nWinston, Clifford, \"The Evolution of the Airline Industry\", Brookings Institution Press, 1995.

        "content": "Ticketer is the brand name for a range of electronic ticket machines provided by British company Corvia Ltd, primarily for usage on buses. The cloud-based system, first marketed on a small scale in 2008, has since developed into a rival to the three major ticket issuing systems used by bus companies throughout Britain.\n\n\n== History and development ==\nTicketer was developed in the mid-2000s by two former employees of Wayfarer Transit Systems, a major supplier of public transport fare collection systems. The company they set up dealt with small, independent bus operators, many of which used Wayfarer machines but wanted a simpler system which was easier to upgrade and configure in-house. In partnership with a mobile app developer, the company set up a prototype consisting of a thermal printer and a mobile computer running on the Windows CE operating system. Independent operator Courtney Buses trialled this system during 2007 and 2008; a modified version was then designed and offered for sale under the Ticketer brand. In 2009 the newly formed company Corvia Ltd bought the rights to the system and began to market it widely, particularly to independent bus operators.\nIn September 2018, private equity firm Tenzing invested in Ticketer. In 2019, Ticketer acquired FARA, a transport ticketing company in the Nordics. In 2020, Ticketer won a Queen's Awards for Enterprise in the Innovation category.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThere are four parts to the Ticketer system's hardware, some are generic \"off-the-shelf\" products and some are custom developed components, components can be replaced individually if necessary. There is a touch-screen mobile computer with a built-in GPS beacon and modem that forms the control unit. This is connected to a custom communications and power board which provides connectivity to the thermal printer and card reader and barcode scanner and any additional bus hardware such as destination displays. A smartcard reader with ITSO compatibility is mounted alongside this. The built-in GPS means that the ticket machines double up as a tracking device, and they communicate back to the office via GPRS.\nCorvia licenses out the Ticketer system per machine, allowing for an unlimited number of concurrent uses of the ticket machine. Ticketer requires no depot infrastructure to run; instead, it is run as a cloud-based software as a service (SaaS). Older ticket issuing systems required machines to be returned to a depot for data transfer—either wirelessly via a local area network or physically using an external module into which the machine would be docked.\nMessages between the driver and depot can also be sent via the ticket machine and fares can easily be changed through an online portal. All configuration of fares, route data and graphical features on tickets (such as operator logos and customised advertisements—a feature developed in 2017) is done through a secure web-based interface accessible through any device with online access. Updates are downloaded to machines in real time via GPRS.\nSince early 2017 Ticketer has fully supported contactless payment, and has been used on buses in order to introduce such technology. The system collects such payments from one customer into one large transaction, which cuts down on charges received when dealing with card payments. Around the same time, separate 2D barcode scanners were introduced and can be added on to the system, and barcodes have started to be printed on certain types of ticket.\nIn 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Ticketer added a passenger counting feature, allowing operators to limit the number of passengers on a bus as a social distancing measure. Live passenger counts can be displayed on websites and apps.\nIn 2021, Ticketer piloted a road restriction alert feature, where the ticket machine alerts the driver about road restrictions such as low bridges, intended to help prevent bridge strikes.\n\n\n== Products ==\nThere are four types of ticket machine sold under the Ticketer brand, with different hardware designs for different purposes. All hardware is manufactured in the United Kingdom, and the software is also developed in the UK. Tickets from each system are similar; most differences are attributable to the different printers used.\n\n\n=== Ticketer Large ===\n\nThe \"most popular\" ticket machine, Ticketer Large, is designed for busy urban routes. It is a fixed point solution, with an ITSO-compliant smart card reader, printer and an electronic point of sale machine. This was the original Ticketer system; the other three machines, which differ only in their hardware, were developed by Corvia at the request of bus operators who had special requirements.\n\n\n=== Ticketer Compact ===\nA smaller version of the large system, Ticketer Compact, is designed for buses where passengers alight away from the driver. The printer is smaller and the card reader is mounted on top of it. There is no QR code reader. It is used especially by \"community bus\" operators which use small vehicles with non-standard interior layouts.\n\n\n=== Handheld ETM ===\nA completely mobile machine, named \"Handheld ETM\", was launched in 2014. It is an all-in-one solution designed for instances where fixed machines cannot be used, with the same functionality. The control unit, printer and card reader are mounted together in a portable case which can also be fixed inside a bus if necessary. Users include operators of occasional services or routes on which tickets would rarely be issued (such as school buses).\n\n\n=== Ticketer in a Case ===\nThis is identical to the Ticketer Large but is mounted onto the side of a stainless steel case and can be operated by mains power. It is intended for semi-mobile solutions, such as where a machine may need to be used outside the bus.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nUntil Ticketer was launched, most bus companies used ticket machines from one of three rival companies: Metric Group Ltd's Almex system, the Wayfarer system of Parkeon, and Vix Technology's Vix-ERG system. Most early users were small independent operators and municipally owned bus companies, but the placing of orders in early 2017 by the Oxford Bus Company and First Glasgow presaged the large transport groups such as FirstGroup and Go-Ahead Group adopting Ticketer more widely. It was adopted by both Oxford Bus Company (whose order included a Handheld ETM terminal for use at the Gloucester Green bus station in Oxford) and Thames Travel in late March 2017; and FirstGroup's Aberdeen and Hampshire & Dorset divisions adopted it in early April 2017 and late July 2017 respectively.\nFirstGroup completed the implementation of the Ticketer machines in 2018. In 2019, Arriva completed their rollout of the Ticketer Standard machine, alongside all non-London Go-Ahead Group companies.\nIn 2023, Transport for Greater Manchester awarded Ticketer a contract to supply ticket machines for the region's new franchised Bee Network bus services from September 2023. The machines will be the next generation model, based on an Android tablet computer.\n\n\n== Problems ==\nIn the case of Reading Buses, 11,500 pre-paid smart cards had to be reissued so they were able to work with Ticketer.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In computer science, a knowledge base (KB) is a set of sentences, each sentence given in a knowledge representation language, with interfaces to tell new sentences and to ask questions about what is known, where either of these interfaces might use inference. It is a technology used to store complex structured data used by a computer system. The initial use of the term was in connection with expert systems, which were the first knowledge-based systems.\n\n\n== Original usage of the term ==\nThe original use of the term knowledge base was to describe one of the two sub-systems of an expert system. A knowledge-based system consists of a knowledge-base representing facts about the world and ways of reasoning about those facts to deduce new facts or highlight inconsistencies.\n\n\n== Properties ==\nThe term knowledge base was coined to distinguish this form of knowledge store from the more common and widely used term database. During the 1970s, virtually all large management information systems stored their data in some type of hierarchical or relational database. At this point in the history of information technology, the distinction between a database and a knowledge-base was clear and unambiguous. \nA database had the following properties:\n\nFlat data: Data was usually represented in a tabular format with strings or numbers in each field.\nMultiple users: A conventional database needed to support more than one user or system logged into the same data at the same time.\nTransactions: An essential requirement for a database was to maintain integrity and consistency among data accessed by concurrent users. These are the so-called ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.\nLarge, long-lived data: A corporate database needed to support not just thousands but hundreds of thousands or more rows of data. Such a database usually needed to persist past the specific uses of any individual program; it needed to store data for years and decades rather than for the life of a program.\nThe first knowledge-based systems had data needs that were the opposite of these database requirements. An expert system requires structured data. Not just tables with numbers and strings, but pointers to other objects that in turn have additional pointers. The ideal representation for a knowledge base is an object model (often called an ontology in artificial intelligence literature) with classes, subclasses and instances.\nEarly expert systems also had little need for multiple users or the complexity that comes with requiring transactional properties on data. The data in early expert systems was used to arrive at a specific answer, such as a medical diagnosis, the design of a molecule, or a response to an emergency. Once the solution to the problem was known, there was not a critical demand to store large amounts of data back to a permanent memory store. A more precise statement would be that given the technologies available, researchers compromised and did without these capabilities because they realized they were beyond what could be expected, and they could develop useful solutions to non-trivial problems without them. Even from the beginning, the more astute researchers realized the potential benefits of being able to store, analyze, and reuse knowledge. For example, see the discussion of Corporate Memory in the earliest work of the Knowledge-Based Software Assistant program by Cordell Green et al.\nThe volume requirements were also different for a knowledge-base compared to a conventional database. The knowledge-base needed to know facts about the world. For example, to represent the statement that \"All humans are mortal\", a database typically could not represent this general knowledge but instead would need to store information about thousands of tables that represented information about specific humans. Representing that all humans are mortal and being able to reason about any given human that they are mortal is the work of a knowledge-base. Representing that George, Mary, Sam, Jenna, Mike,... and hundreds of thousands of other customers are all humans with specific ages, sex, address, etc. is the work for a database.\nAs expert systems moved from being prototypes to systems deployed in corporate environments the requirements for their data storage rapidly started to overlap with the standard database requirements for multiple, distributed users with support for transactions. Initially, the demand could be seen in two different but competitive markets. From the AI and Object-Oriented communities, object-oriented databases such as Versant emerged. These were systems designed from the ground up to have support for object-oriented capabilities but also to support standard database services as well. On the other hand, the large database vendors such as Oracle added capabilities to their products that provided support for knowledge-base requirements such as class-subclass relations and rules wiki.\n\n\n== Types of Knowledge Base Systems ==\nAs any informational hub, the knowledge base can store various content types which will serve different audiences and have contrasting purposes. So, to better understand knowledge base types, let’s discuss them from two different angles: purpose and content.\nInternal vs. external knowledge bases\nHere, we can divide our informational hubs into two main purposes – external and internal.\n\nInternal knowledge base: This type of knowledge hub is designed for employees within the organization. It acts like a corporate wiki and can be created for different reasons, but mainly for: onboarding new hires, documenting internal policies, and giving quick answers on employees’ demands.\nExternal knowledge base: This is a direct opposite of the internal hub and is created for clients, prospects, and, sometimes, for the public. The main goal of this base is to reduce customer support workload, offer easy access to effective tips and enhance the overall user experience.\n\n\n== Internet as a knowledge base ==\nThe next evolution for the term knowledge base was the Internet. With the rise of the Internet, documents, hypertext, and multimedia support were now critical for any corporate database. It was no longer enough to support large tables of data or relatively small objects that lived primarily in computer memory. Support for corporate web sites required persistence and transactions for documents. This created a whole new discipline known as Web Content Management.\nThe other driver for document support was the rise of knowledge management vendors such as HCL Notes (formerly Lotus Notes). Knowledge Management actually predated the Internet but with the Internet there was great synergy between the two areas. Knowledge management products adopted the term knowledge base to describe their repositories but the meaning had a big difference. In the case of previous knowledge-based systems, the knowledge was primarily for the use of an automated system, to reason about and draw conclusions about the world. With knowledge management products, the knowledge was primarily meant for humans, for example to serve as a repository of manuals, procedures, policies, best practices, reusable designs and code, etc. In both cases the distinctions between the uses and kinds of systems were ill-defined. As the technology scaled up it was rare to find a system that could really be cleanly classified as knowledge-based in the sense of an expert system that performed automated reasoning and knowledge-based in the sense of knowledge management that provided knowledge in the form of documents and media that could be leveraged by humans.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nCyc\nYAGO (database)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Knowledge management (KM) is the set of procedures for producing, disseminating, utilizing, and overseeing an organization's knowledge and data. It alludes to a multidisciplinary strategy that maximizes knowledge utilization to accomplish organizational goals.\nCourses in business administration, information systems, management, libraries, and information science are all part of knowledge management, a discipline that has been around since 1991. Information and media, computer science, public health, and public policy are some of the other disciplines that may contribute to KM research.\nNumerous academic institutions provide master's degrees specifically focused on knowledge management.\nAs a component of their IT, human resource management, or business strategy departments, many large corporations, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations have resources devoted to internal knowledge management initiatives. These organizations receive KM guidance from a number of consulting firms.\nOrganizational goals including enhanced performance, competitive advantage, innovation, sharing of lessons learned, integration, and ongoing organizational improvement are usually the focus of knowledge management initiatives. These initiatives are similar to organizational learning, but they can be differentiated by their increased emphasis on knowledge management as a strategic asset and information sharing. Organizational learning is facilitated by knowledge management.\nThe setting of supply chain may be the most challenging situation for knowledge management since it involves several businesses without a hierarchy or ownership tie; some authors refer to this type of knowledge as transorganizational or interorganizational knowledge. industry 4.0 (or 4th industrial revolution) and digital transformation also add to that complexity, as new issues arise from the volume and speed of information flows and knowledge generation.\n\n\n== History ==\nKnowledge management efforts have a long history, including on-the-job discussions, formal apprenticeship, discussion forums, corporate libraries, professional training, and mentoring programs. With increased use of computers in the second half of the 20th century, specific adaptations of technologies such as knowledge bases, expert systems, information repositories, group decision support systems, intranets, and computer-supported cooperative work have been introduced to further enhance such efforts.\nIn 1999, the term personal knowledge management was introduced; it refers to the management of knowledge at the individual level.\nIn the enterprise, early collections of case studies recognised the importance of knowledge management dimensions of strategy, process and measurement. Key lessons learned include people and the cultural norms which influence their behaviors are the most critical resources for successful knowledge creation, dissemination and application; cognitive, social and organisational learning processes are essential to the success of a knowledge management strategy; and measurement, benchmarking and incentives are essential to accelerate the learning process and to drive cultural change. In short, knowledge management programs can yield impressive benefits to individuals and organisations if they are purposeful, concrete and action-orientated.\nThe ISO 9001:2015 quality management standard released in September 2015 introduced a specification for 'organizational knowledge' as a complementary aspect of quality management within an organisation.\n\n\n== Research ==\nKM emerged as a scientific discipline in the early 1990s. It was initially supported by individual practitioners, when Skandia hired Leif Edvinsson of Sweden as the world's first chief knowledge officer (CKO). Hubert Saint-Onge (formerly of CIBC, Canada), started investigating KM long before that. The objective of CKOs is to manage and maximise the intangible assets of their organizations. Gradually, CKOs became interested in practical and theoretical aspects of KM, and the new research field was formed. The KM idea has been taken up by academics, such as Ikujiro Nonaka (Hitotsubashi University), Hirotaka Takeuchi (Hitotsubashi University), Thomas H. Davenport (Babson College) and Baruch Lev (New York University).\nIn 2001, Thomas A. Stewart, former editor at Fortune magazine and subsequently the editor of Harvard Business Review, published a cover story highlighting the importance of intellectual capital in organizations. The KM discipline has been gradually moving towards academic maturity. First, is a trend toward higher cooperation among academics; single-author publications are less common. Second, the role of practitioners has changed. Their contribution to academic research declined from 30% of overall contributions up to 2002, to only 10% by 2009. Third, the number of academic knowledge management journals has been steadily growing, currently reaching 27 outlets.\nMultiple KM disciplines exist; approaches vary by author and school. As the discipline matured, academic debates increased regarding theory and practice, including:\n\nTechno-centric with a focus on technology, ideally those that enhance knowledge sharing and creation.\nOrganisational with a focus on how an organisation can be designed to facilitate knowledge processes best.\nEcological with a focus on the interaction of people, identity, knowledge, and environmental factors as a complex adaptive system akin to a natural ecosystem.\nRegardless of the school of thought, core components of KM roughly include people/culture, processes/structure and technology.  The details depend on the  perspective. KM perspectives include:\n\ncommunity of practice\nsocial network analysis\nintellectual capital\ninformation theory\ncomplexity science\nconstructivism\nThe practical relevance of academic research in KM has been questioned with action research suggested as having more relevance and the need to translate the findings presented in academic journals to a practice.\n\n\n=== Dimensions ===\nDifferent frameworks for distinguishing between different 'types of' knowledge exist. One proposed framework for categorising the dimensions of knowledge distinguishes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge represents internalised knowledge that an individual may not be consciously aware of, such as to accomplish particular tasks. At the opposite end of the spectrum, explicit knowledge represents knowledge that the individual holds consciously in mental focus, in a form that can easily be communicated to others.\n\nIkujiro Nonaka proposed a model (SECI, for Socialisation, Externalisation, Combination, Internalisation) which considers a spiraling interaction between explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge. In this model, knowledge follows a cycle in which implicit knowledge is 'extracted' to become explicit knowledge, and explicit knowledge is 're-internalised' into implicit knowledge.\nHayes and Walsham (2003) describe knowledge and knowledge management as two different perspectives. The content perspective suggests that knowledge is easily stored; because it may be codified, while the relational perspective recognises the contextual and relational aspects of knowledge which can make knowledge difficult to share outside the specific context in which it is developed.\nEarly research suggested that KM needs to convert internalised tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge to share it, and the same effort must permit individuals to internalise and make personally meaningful any codified knowledge retrieved from the KM effort.\nSubsequent research suggested that a distinction between tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge represented an oversimplification and that the notion of explicit knowledge is self-contradictory. Specifically, for knowledge to be made explicit, it must be translated into information (i.e., symbols outside our heads).  More recently, together with Georg von Krogh and Sven Voelpel, Nonaka returned to his earlier work in an attempt to move the debate about knowledge conversion forward.\nA second proposed framework for categorising knowledge dimensions distinguishes embedded knowledge of a system outside a human individual (e.g., an information system may have knowledge embedded into its design) from embodied knowledge representing a learned capability of a human body's nervous and endocrine systems.\nA third proposed framework distinguishes between the exploratory creation of \"new knowledge\" (i.e., innovation) vs. the transfer or exploitation of \"established knowledge\" within a group, organisation, or community. Collaborative environments such as communities of practice or the use of social computing tools can be used for both knowledge creation and transfer.\n\n\n=== Strategies ===\nKnowledge may be accessed at three stages: before, during, or after KM-related activities. Organisations have tried knowledge capture incentives, including making content submission mandatory and incorporating rewards into performance measurement plans. Considerable controversy exists over whether such incentives work and no consensus has emerged.\nOne strategy to KM involves actively managing knowledge (push strategy). In such an instance, individuals strive to explicitly encode their knowledge into a shared knowledge repository, such as a database, as well as retrieving knowledge they need that other individuals have provided (codification). Another strategy involves individuals making knowledge requests of experts associated with a particular subject on an ad hoc basis (pull strategy). In such an instance, expert individual(s) provide insights to requestor (personalisation). When talking about strategic knowledge management, the form of the knowledge and activities to share it defines the concept between codification and personalization. The form of the knowledge means that it's either tacit or explicit. Data and information can be considered as explicit and know-how can be considered as tacit.\nHansen et al. defined the two strategies (codification and personalisation). Codification means a system-oriented method in KM strategy for managing explicit knowledge with organizational objectives. Codification strategy is document-centered strategy, where knowledge is mainly codified as \"people-to-document\" method. Codification relies on information infrastructure, where explicit knowledge is carefully codified and stored. Codification focuses on collecting and storing codified knowledge in electronic databases to make it accessible. Codification can therefore refer to both tacit and explicit knowledge. In contrast, personalisation encourages individuals to share their knowledge directly. Personification means human-oriented KM strategy where the target is to improve knowledge flows through networking and integrations related to tacit knowledge with knowledge sharing and creation. Information technology plays a less important role, as it only facilitates communication and knowledge sharing.\nGeneric knowledge strategies include knowledge acquisition strategy, knowledge exploitation strategy, knowledge exploration strategy, and knowledge sharing strategy. These strategies aim at helping organisations to increase their knowledge and competitive advantage.\nOther knowledge management strategies and instruments for companies include:\n\nKnowledge sharing (fostering a culture that encourages the sharing of information, based on the concept that knowledge is not irrevocable and should be shared and updated to remain relevant)\nMake knowledge-sharing a key role in employees' job description\nInter-project knowledge transfer\nIntra-organisational knowledge sharing\nInter-organisational knowledge sharing\nKnowledge retention also known as Knowledge Continuation: activities addressing the challenge of knowledge loss as a result of people leaving\nMapping knowledge competencies, roles and identifying current or future predicted gaps.\nDefining for each chosen role the main knowledge that should be retained, and building rituals in which the knowledge is documented or transferred on, from the day they start their job.\nTransfer of knowledge and information prior to employee departure by means of sharing documents, shadowing, mentoring, and more,\nProximity & architecture (the physical situation of employees can be either conducive or obstructive to knowledge sharing)\nStorytelling (as a means of transferring tacit knowledge)\nCross-project learning\nAfter-action reviews\nKnowledge mapping requires the organization to know what kind of knowledge organization it has, how it is distributed throughout the company, and how to efficiently use and re-use that knowledge. (a map of knowledge repositories within a company accessible by all)\nCommunities of practice\nExpert directories (to enable knowledge seeker to reach to the experts)\nExpert systems (knowledge seeker responds to one or more specific questions to reach knowledge in a repository)\nBest practice transfer\nKnowledge fairs\nCompetency-based management (systematic evaluation and planning of knowledge related competences of individual organisation members)\nMaster–apprentice relationship, Mentor-mentee relationship, job shadowing\nCollaborative software technologies (wikis, shared bookmarking, blogs, social software, etc.)\nKnowledge repositories (databases, bookmarking engines, etc.)\nMeasuring and reporting intellectual capital (a way of making explicit knowledge for companies)\nKnowledge brokers (some organisational members take on responsibility for a specific \"field\" and act as first reference on a specific subject)\nKnowledge farming (using note-taking software to cultivate a knowledge graph, part of knowledge agriculture)\nKnowledge capturing (refers to a process where trained people extract valuable or else desired knowledge from experts and embed it in databases)\n\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMultiple motivations lead organisations to undertake KM. Typical considerations include:\n\nMaking available increased knowledge content in the development and provision of products and services\nAchieving shorter development cycles\nImproving consistency of knowledge and standardized expert skills among staff\nFacilitating and managing innovation and organisational learning\nLeveraging expertise across the organisation\nIncreasing network connectivity between internal and external individuals\nManaging business environments and allowing employees to obtain relevant insights and ideas appropriate to their work\nSolving intractable or wicked problems\nManaging intellectual capital and assets in the workforce (such as the expertise and know-how possessed by key individuals or stored in repositories)\n\n\n== KM technologies ==\nKnowledge management (KM) technology can be categorised:\n\nCollaborative software(Groupware)—Software that facilitates collaboration and sharing of organisational information. Such applications provide tools for threaded discussions, document sharing, organisation-wide uniform email, and other collaboration-related features.\nWorkflow systems—Systems that allow the representation of processes associated with the creation, use and maintenance of organisational knowledge, such as the process of creating and utilise forms and documents.\nContent management and document management systems—Software systems that automate the process of creating web content and/or documents. Roles such as editors, graphic designers, writers and producers can be explicitly modeled along with the tasks in the process and validation criteria. Commercial vendors started either to support documents or to support web content but as the Internet grew these functions merged and vendors now perform both functions.\nEnterprise portals—Software that aggregates information across the entire organisation or for groups such as project teams.\neLearning—Software that enables organisations to create customised training and education. This can include lesson plans, monitoring progress and online classes.\nPlanning and scheduling software—Software that automates schedule creation and maintenance. The planning aspect can be integrated with project management software.\nTelepresence—Software that enables individuals to have virtual \"face-to-face\" meetings without assembling at one location. Videoconferencing is the most obvious example.\nSemantic technology such as ontologies—Systems that encode meaning alongside data to give machines the ability to extract and infer information.\nThese categories overlap. Workflow, for example, is a significant aspect of content or document management systems, most of which have tools for developing enterprise portals. \nProprietary KM technology products such as HCL Notes (Previously Lotus Notes) defined proprietary formats for email, documents, forms, etc. The Internet drove most vendors to adopt Internet formats. Open-source and freeware tools for the creation of blogs and wikis now enable capabilities that used to require expensive commercial tools.\nKM is driving the adoption of tools that enable organisations to work at the semantic level, as part of the Semantic Web. Some commentators have argued that after many years the Semantic Web has failed to see widespread adoption, while other commentators have argued that it has been a success.\n\n\n== Knowledge barriers ==\nJust like knowledge transfer and knowledge sharing, the term \"knowledge barriers\" is not a uniformly defined term and differs in its meaning depending on the author. Knowledge barriers can be associated with high costs for both companies and individuals.\nKnowledge barriers appear to have been used from at least three different perspectives in the literature:\n1) Missing knowledge about something as a result of barriers for the share or transfer of knowledge.\n2) Insufficient knowledge based on the amount of education in a certain field or issue.\n3) A unique individual or group of humans' perceptual system lacks adequate contact points or does not fit incoming information to use and transform it to knowledge.\n\n\n== Knowledge retention ==\nKnowledge retention is part of knowledge management. It helps convert tacit form of knowledge into an explicit form. It is a complex process which aims to reduce the knowledge loss in the organization. Knowledge retention is needed when expert knowledge workers leave the organization after a long career. Retaining knowledge prevents losing intellectual capital.\nAccording to DeLong(2004)  knowledge retention strategies are divided into four main categories:\n\nHuman resources, processes and practices\nKnowledge transfer practices\nKnowledge recovery practices\nInformation technologies used to capture, store and share knowledge.\nKnowledge retention projects are usually introduced in three stages: decision making, planning and implementation. There are differences among researchers on the terms of the stages. For example, Dalkir talks about knowledge capture, sharing and acquisition and Doan et al. introduces initiation, implementation and evaluation. Furthermore, Levy introduces three steps (scope, transfer, integration) but also recognizes a \"zero stage\" for initiation of the project.\n\n\n== Knowledge audit ==\nA knowledge audit is a comprehensive assessment of an organization's knowledge assets, including its explicit and tacit knowledge, intellectual capital, expertise, and skills. The goal of a knowledge audit is to identify the organization's knowledge strengths and gaps, and to develop strategies for leveraging knowledge to improve performance and competitiveness. Knowledge audit helps ensure that an organization's knowledge management activities are heading in the right direction. It also reduces the making of incorrect decisions. Term knowledge audit is often used interchangeably with information audit, although information audit is slightly narrower in scope.\nThe requirement and significance of a knowledge audit can vary widely among different industries and companies. For instance, within the software development industry, knowledge audits can play a pivotal role due to the inherently knowledge-intensive nature of the work. This contrasts with sectors like manufacturing, where physical assets often take more important role. The difference arises from the fact that in software development companies, the skills, expertise, and intellectual capital, often overshadow the value of physical assets.\nKnowledge audits provide opportunities for organizations to improve their management of knowledge assets, with the goal of enhancing organizational effectiveness and efficiency. By conducting a knowledge audit, organizations can raise awareness of knowledge assets as primary factors of production and as critical capital assets in today's knowledge economy. The process of a knowledge audit allows organizations to gain a deeper understanding of their knowledge assets. This includes identifying and defining these assets, understanding their behavior and properties, and describing how, when, why, and where they are used in business processes.\n\n\n== Knowledge protection ==\nKnowledge protection refers to behaviors and actions taken to protect the knowledge from unwanted opportunistic behavior for example appropriation or imitation of the knowledge.\nKnowledge protection is used to prevent the knowledge to be unintentionally available or useful for competitors. Knowledge protection can be for example a patent, copyright, trademark, lead time or secrecy held by a company or an individual.\n\n\n=== Knowledge protection methods ===\nThere are various methods for knowledge protection and those methods are often divided into two categories by their formality: formal protection and informal protection. Occasionally a third category is introduced, semi-formal protection, which includes contracts and trade-secrets.  These semi-formal methods are also usually placed under formal methods.\nOrganizations often use a combination of formal and informal knowledge protection methods to achieve comprehensive protection of their knowledge assets. The formal and informal knowledge protection mechanisms are different in nature, and they have their benefits and drawbacks. In many organizations, the challenge is to find a good mix of measures that works for the organization.\n\n\n==== Formal methods ====\nFormal knowledge protection practices can take various forms, such as legal instruments or formal procedures and structures, to control which knowledge is shared and which is protected. Formal knowledge protection methods include for example: patents, trademarks, copyrights and licensing.\nTechnical solutions to protect the knowledge fall also under the category of formal knowledge protection. Formal knowledge protection from technical viewpoint includes technical access constraints and protection of communication channels, systems, and storage.\nWhile knowledge may eventually become public in some form or another, formal protection mechanisms are necessary to prevent competitors from directly utilizing it for their own gain. Formal protection methods are particularly effective in protecting established knowledge that can be codified and embodied in final products or services.\n\n\n==== Informal methods ====\nInformal knowledge protection methods refer to the use of informal mechanisms such as human resource management practices or secrecy to protect knowledge assets. There is notable amount of knowledge that cannot be protected by formal methods, and for which more informal protection might be the most efficient option.\nInformal knowledge protection methods can take various forms, such as: secrecy, social norms and values, complexity, lead-time and Human resource management.\nInformal knowledge protection methods protect knowledge assets for example by making it difficult for outsiders to access and understand the knowledge within the boundaries of the organization. Informal protection methods are more effective for protecting knowledge that is complex or difficult to express, articulate, or codify.\n\n\n=== Balancing knowledge protection and knowledge sharing ===\nThe balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a critical dilemma faced by organizations today. While sharing knowledge can lead to innovation, collaboration, and competitive advantage, protecting knowledge can prevent it from being misused, misappropriated, or lost. Thus, the need for organizational learning must be balanced with the need to protect organisations' intellectual property, especially whilst cooperating with external partners. The role of information security is crucial in helping organisations protect their assets whilst still enabling the benefits of information sharing. By implementing effective knowledge management strategies, organizations can protect valuable intellectual property while also encouraging the sharing of relevant knowledge across teams and departments. This active balancing act requires careful consideration of factors such as the level of openness, the identification of core knowledge areas, and the establishment of appropriate mechanisms for knowledge transfer and collaboration. Finding the right balance between knowledge sharing and knowledge protection is a complex issue that requires a nuanced understanding of the trade-off's involved and the context in which knowledge is shared or protected.\n\n\n=== Knowledge protection risks ===\nProtecting knowledge cannot be considered without its risks. Here are listed four of the major risks associated with knowledge protection:\n\nOverprotection: One of the major risks of knowledge protection is overprotection. Overprotection occurs when intellectual property rights are too broad or too strict, preventing others from building upon existing ideas and stifling innovation. As noted by Rouyre and Fernandez, overprotection can have a chilling effect on follow-on innovation, which is particularly problematic in fields where innovation is cumulative.\nMisappropriation: Another risk associated with knowledge protection is misappropriation. Misappropriation refers to the unauthorized use or theft of intellectual property. This can occur when confidential information is leaked, trade secrets are stolen, or patents are infringed upon. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, misappropriation can result in significant financial losses for individuals and organizations.\nInfringement claims: Intellectual property owners can also face risks associated with infringement claims. Infringement occurs when someone uses intellectual property without permission or authorization, and the owner of the intellectual property files a lawsuit. Infringement claims can be costly and time-consuming and can result in damage to an individual's or organization's reputation. As noted by Law Insider's Knowledge of infringement Sample Clauses, infringement claims can also result in financial penalties and even criminal prosecution.\nInadequate protection: Inadequate protection of intellectual property is also a significant risk. This occurs when intellectual property owners fail to properly protect their knowledge, such as by failing to obtain patents, trademarks, or copyrights. Inadequate protection can result in the loss of intellectual property rights and can make it difficult for individuals and organizations to enforce their rights in court. As noted by the WIPO, inadequate protection can also make it easier for others to copy or steal intellectual property.\nIn conclusion, protecting knowledge is crucial to promote innovation and creativity, but it is not without its risks. Overprotection, misappropriation, infringement claims, and inadequate protection are all risks associated with knowledge protection. Individuals and organizations should take steps to protect their intellectual property while also considering the potential risks and benefits of such protection.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Knowledge management software (KM software) is a subset of content management software, which consists of software that specializes in the way information is collected, stored and/or accessed. The concept of knowledge management is based on the practices of an individual, a business, or a corporation to identify, create, represent and redistribute information in support of organizational goals. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called information management software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called knowledge management software.\nKM software in most cases provides a means for individuals, small groups or mid-sized businesses to innovate, build new knowledge in the group, and/or improve customer experience. Knowledge management systems (software) include a range of about 1,500 or more different approaches to collect and contain information to then build knowledge that can be searched through specialised search tools. These include concept building tools and/or visual search tools that present information in a connected manner not originally conceptualised by those collecting or maintaining the information database.\nOne of the main categories of knowledge management software is groupware, which can be used for knowledge sharing and capture. Groupware is a combination of synchronous, asynchronous and community focused tools. Groupware can be used to exchange knowledge and expertise even when the team members are situated around the world.\n\n\n== Features ==\nFeatures of KM software usually include:\n\nAggregation of content from both internal and external sources\nClassification of content using taxonomies\nSearch\nExpertise location\nWorkflows for creating knowledge\nVerification of knowledge\nViews/dashboards\nAs business today is becoming increasingly international, the ability to access information in different languages is now a requirement for some organizations. Reported success factors of a KM system include the capability to integrate well with existing internal systems  and the scalability of the system to grow within the organization.\n\n\n== Range ==\nKM software ranges from small software packages for an individual to use to highly specialized enterprise software suitable for use by hundreds of employees. Often KM software provides a key resource for employees working in customer service or telephone support industries, or sectors of large corporations.\nKnowledge management software, in general, enables the combination of unstructured information sources, such as individual word processed documents and/or PDF documents, email, graphic illustrations, unstructured notes, website links, invoices, and other information bearing collections, such as a simple thought, through to a combination of millions of interactions from a website, and through that combination enables the seeker to obtain knowledge that otherwise would not have been discovered. As Internet access speeds increased, many on-demand (or software as a service) products have evolved and are now the leading suppliers of KM software.\n\n\n== Visual search ==\nOne of the departures from the almost standard keyword search approach are those group of companies developing visual search techniques. Some common visual search approaches include: \n\nTree traversal – A folder is opened and inside the display of that folder are further sub-folders. The folders are searched in a specific order, exactly once, in a systematic manner. This tree traversal approach relies on the naming of folders to provide a rich enough indication as to what is contained in the next folder or level of folders.\nTaxonomy navigation – A taxonomy (or topic map) is the classification of things or concepts, as well as the principles underlying such classification. In KM software, taxonomies are often used as a way of visually structuring the available information by tagging it with relevant topics and visually represent them as folders and sub-folders inside the taxonomy. Users can then navigate the taxonomy and select the topic, or combination of topics (faceted search), to perform the search on.\nTag cloud search – Once text data has been tagged with certain topics it can be visually represented as a Tag Cloud, where the importance of each tag is represented as a font size and/or color. This way you can identify and pick the most prominent topics.\nMatrix/heat map search – The classification of information into topics facilitates visualization and analysis of the information flow. A combined topic search can be presented as values in a Matrix, and a Heat Map is a graphical representation of that data, presented in colors.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nNotable knowledge management tools include:\n\nDocument360 - AI powered knowledge management software\nBloomfire – Knowledge sharing software with AI\nCollective Knowledge – An open source, portable and command line framework for knowledge management\nConfluence – Wiki-based knowledge management software that is part of Atlassian's suite\neGain – Knowledge management and AI software\nElium – Knowledge management software\nJoplin – Open source knowledge management software\nObsidian - knowledge management software\nTrillium - Open source knowledge management software\nLogseq – Open source knowledge management software\nNotion (productivity software) – Proprietary knowledge management software\nMicrosoft OneNote – Proprietary knowledge management software\nOpenKM – Open source knowledge management software\n\n\n== See also ==\nEnterprise content management\nCustomer knowledge\nKnowledge base\nKnowledge extraction\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "content": "Customer retention refers to the ability of a company or product to retain its customers over some specified period. High customer retention means customers of the product or business tend to return to, continue to buy or in some other way not defect to another product or business, or to non-use entirely. Selling organizations generally attempt to reduce customer defections. Customer retention starts with the first contact an organization has with a customer and continues throughout the entire lifetime of a relationship and successful retention efforts take this entire lifecycle into account. A company's ability to attract and retain new customers is related not only to its product or services, but also to the way it services its existing customers, the value the customers actually perceive as a result of utilizing the solutions, and the reputation it creates within and across the marketplace.\nSuccessful customer retention involves more than giving the customer what they expect. Generating loyal advocates of the brand might mean exceeding customer expectations. Creating customer loyalty puts 'customer value rather than maximizing profits and shareholder value at the center of business strategy'. The key differentiation in a competitive environment is often the delivery of a consistently high standard of customer service. Furthermore, in the emerging world of Customer Success, retention is a major objective.\nCustomer retention has a direct impact on profitability. Research by John Fleming and Jim Asplund indicates that engaged customers generate 1.7 times more revenue than normal customers while having engaged employees and engaged customers return a revenue gain of 3.4 times the norm.\n\n\n== Measurement ==\nThe measurement of customer retention should distinguish between behavioral intentions and actual customer behaviors. The use of behavioral intentions as an indicator of customer retention is based on the premise that intentions are a strong predictor of future behaviors, such that customers who express a stronger repurchase intention toward a brand or firm will also exhibit stronger corresponding behaviors. Customer repurchase and retention behaviors can be measured in a variety of different ways which are enumerated in several award-winning articles published in the marketing discipline. The different studies that also involve different metrics to measure customer repurchase intention and actual repurchase behaviors are summarized in a series of review papers such as Keiningham and colleagues (2007), and Morgan and Rego (2006). These studies point to the following general conclusions:\n\nCustomer satisfaction is a strong predictor of both customer repurchase intentions and repurchase behavior\nRepurchase intentions are statistically significant, and positively associated with repurchase behavior: as people's repurchase intention increases, so does their likelihood to actually repurchase the brand. However, the magnitude of the association, though positive, is moderate to weak—suggesting that intentions and behaviors are not interchangeable constructs to measure customer retention.\nThe association between different retention metrics is not always straightforward. It can be (a) non-linear exhibiting increasing or diminishing returns, (b) different for different customer segments), and also vary by type of industry.\nCustomer retention is a strong predictor of a firm's financial success, both using accounting and stock market metrics. A study of a Brazilian bank showed that bank branches that were more adept at efficiently satisfying and retaining customers were more profitable than their counterparts that did one or the other but not both.\nIn terms of measurement, the intention measures can typically be obtained using scale items embedded in a customer survey. The retention behaviors must be measured using secondary data such as/ accounting measures of the volume (amount and financial value) and frequency with which a customer purchases the firm's goods or services. This requires that the firm should have a strong customer information management department that can capture all the relevant metrics that may be needed for analysis. In a typical firm, these may come from a diverse set of departments such as accounting, sales, marketing, finance, logistics, and other customer research.\n\n\n== Antecedents and drivers ==\nCustomer retention is an outcome that is the result of several different antecedents as described below.\n\nCustomer satisfaction: Research shows that customer satisfaction is a direct driver of customer retention in a wide variety of industries. Despite the claims made by some one-off studies, the bulk of the evidence is unambiguously clear: there is a positive association between customer satisfaction and customer retention/ though the magnitude of the association can vary based on a whole host of factors such as customer, product, and industry characteristics. Some companies and individuals have created mathematical models to evaluate customer satisfaction.\nCustomer delight: Some scholars argue that in today's competitive world, merely satisfying customers is not enough; firms need to delight customers by providing exceptionally strong service. It is delighted customers who are likely to stay with the firm, and improve overall customer retention. More recently, it has been argued that customer delight may be more strongly applicable to hedonic goods and services rather than for utilitarian products and services.\nCustomer switching costs: Burnham, Frels, and Mahajan (2003, p. 110) define switching costs as \"one-time costs that customers associate with the process of switching from one provider to another.\"  Customers usually encounter three types of switching costs: (1) financial switching costs (e.g., fees to break contract, lost reward points); (2) procedural switching costs (time, effort, and uncertainty in locating, adopting, and using a new brand/provider); and (3) relational switching costs (personal relationships and identification with brand and employees).  A recent meta-analysis examined 233 effects from over 133,000 customers and found that all three types of switching costs increased customer retention—however, relational switching costs have the strongest association with customer repurchase intentions and behavior.\nCustomer relationship management: Acknowledging the social and relational aspects—especially those embedded in services—it has been argued that firms can increase retention by focusing on managing customer relationships. Relationship management occurs when firms can take a longer-terms perspective, rather than a transactional perspective to managing their customer base. However, all long-term customers are not profitable, and worth retaining; sometimes, short-term transactional customers can be more profitable for the firm. As such, companies may have to strategically develop a framework to manage unprofitable customers.\n\n\n== Customer lifetime value ==\nCustomer lifetime value enables an organization to calculate the net present value of the profit an organization will realize on a customer over a given period of time. Retention Rate is the percentage of the total number of customers retained in context to the customers that approached for cancelation.\n\n\n== Standardization of customer service ==\nPublished standards exist to help organizations deliver process-driven customer satisfaction and Customer Success in order to increase the lifespan of a customer. The International Customer Service Institute (TICSI) has released The International Standard for Service Excellence (TISSE 2012). TISSE 2012 enables organizations to focus their attention on delivering excellence in the management of customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party certification scheme. TISSE 2012 focuses an organization's attention on delivering increased customer satisfaction by helping the organization through a Service Quality Model.  TISSE Service Quality Model uses the 5 P's - Policy, Processes, People, Premises, Product/Service, as well as performance measurement. The implementation of a customer service standard leads to improved customer service practices, underlying operating procedures and eventually, higher levels of customer satisfaction, which in turn increases customer loyalty and customer retention.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChurn rate – Measure of individuals moving out of a group\nCustomer attrition – Loss of clients or customers\nCustomer loyalty – Marketing term for a consumer's emotional attachment to a given brandPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nCustomer service – Provision of service to customers\nCustomer Success – Proactive outcome-focused business methodologyPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nSerial switcher – Marketing termPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nThe International Customer Service Institute – International partnership organisation for sharing of best practices in customer service\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Customer engagement is a marketing and strategic management concept. Practitioners view it as interactions, \"engagements\", between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state that “occurs by virtue of interactive customer experiences with a focal agent/object”, where focal agent/object can be any type of organization and/or its offerings such as branded products or services. As such, customer engagement is seen as a customer’s motivationally driven, volitional cognitive, emotional, and behavioral investments into interactions with such a focal agent/object.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nIn March 2006, the Advertising Research Foundation announced the first definition of customer engagement as \"turning on a prospect to a brand idea enhanced by the surrounding context.\" However, the ARF definition was criticized by some for being too broad. The ARF, World Federation of Advertisers,  Various definitions have translated different aspects of customer engagement. Forrester Consulting's research in 2008, has defined customer engagement as \"creating deep connections with customers that drive purchase decisions, interaction, and participation, over time\". Studies by the Economist Intelligence Unit result in defining customer engagement as, \"an intimate long-term relationship with the customer\". Both of these concepts prescribe that customer engagement is attributed to a rich association formed with customers. With aspects of relationship marketing and service-dominant perspectives, customer engagement can be loosely defined as \"consumers' proactive contributions in co-creating their personalized experiences and perceived value with organizations through active, explicit, and ongoing dialogue and interactions\". The book, Best Digital Marketing Campaigns In The World, defines customer engagement as, \"mutually beneficial relationships with a constantly growing community of online consumers\". The various definitions of customer engagement are diversified by different perspectives and contexts of the engagement process. These are determined by the brand, product, or service, the audience profile, attitudes and behaviours, and messages and channels of communication that are used to interact with the customer.\nSince 2009, a number of new definitions have been proposed in the literature. In 2011, the term was defined as \"the level of a customer’s cognitive, emotional and behavioral investment in specific brand interactions,\" and identifies the three CE dimensions of immersion (cognitive), passion (emotional) and activation (behavioral). It was also defined as \"a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive, co-creative customer experiences with a particular agent/object (e.g. a brand)\". Researchers have based their work on customer engagement as a multi-dimensional construct, while also identifying that it is context-dependent. Engagement gets manifested in the various interactions that customers undertake, which in turn get shaped up by individual cultures. The context is not limited to geographical context, but also includes the medium with which the user engages. Moreover, customer engagement is the emotional involvement and psychological process in which both new and existing consumers become loyal to specific types of services or products. The degree to which customers pay attention to companies or products, as well as their participation in operations, is referred to as customer engagement.\nAt present, practitioners view and define customer engagement as interaction between a firm and its customers, while academic researchers define it as a psychological state of the consumer.\n\n\n== Applications in Marketing ==\nMarketing practices aim to create, stimulate or influence customer behaviour, which places conversions into a more strategic context and is premised on the understanding that a focus on maximising conversions can, in some circumstances, decrease the likelihood of repeat conversions. Although customer advocacy has always been a goal for marketers, the rise of online user-generated content has directly influenced levels of advocacy. Customer engagement targets long-term interactions, encouraging customer loyalty and advocacy through word-of-mouth. Although customer engagement marketing is consistent both online and offline, the internet is the basis for marketing efforts.\n\n\n== Ethics ==\nEfforts to boost user engagement at any expense can lead to social media addiction for both service providers and users. Facebook and several other social media platforms have faced criticism for manipulating user emotions to enhance engagement, even if it is knowingly false content. Professor Hany Farid summarized Facebook’s approach, stating, “When you’re in the business of maximizing engagement, you’re not interested in truth.\" Various other techniques used to increase engagement are also considered abusive. For example, FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), infinite scrolling, and incentives for users who frequently engage with the service. \n\n\n== Online customer engagement ==\nOffline customer engagement predates online, but the latter is a qualitatively different social phenomenon, unlike any offline customer engagement that social theorists or marketers recognize. In the past, customer engagement has been generated irresolutely through television, radio, media, outdoor advertising, and various other touchpoints ideally during peak and/or high trafficked allocations. However, the only conclusive results of campaigns were sales and/or return on investment figures. The widespread adoption of the internet during the late 1990s has enhanced the processes of customer engagement, in particular, the way in which it can now be measured in different ways on different levels of engagement. It is a recent social phenomenon where people engage online in communities that do not necessarily revolve around a particular product but serve as meeting or networking places. This online engagement has brought about both the empowerment of consumers and the opportunity for businesses to engage with their target customers online. A 2011 market analysis revealed that 80% of online customers, after reading negative online reviews, report making alternate purchasing decisions, while 87% of consumers said a favorable review has confirmed their decision to go through with a purchase.\nThe concept and practice of online customer engagement enables organisations to respond to the fundamental changes in customer behaviour that the internet has brought about, as well as to the increasing ineffectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat', broadcast model of advertising. Due to the fragmentation and specialisation of media and audiences, as well as the proliferation of community and user-generated content, businesses are increasingly losing the power to dictate the communications agenda. Simultaneously, lower switching costs, the geographical widening of the market and the vast choice of content, services and products available online have weakened customer loyalty. Enhancing customers' firm and market-related expertise has been shown to engage customers, strengthen their loyalty, and emotionally connect them more closely to a firm.\nSince the world has reached a population of over 3 billion internet users, it is conclusive that society's interactive culture is significantly influenced by technology. Connectivity is bringing consumers and organizations together, which makes it critical for companies to take advantage and focus on capturing the attention of and interacting with well-informed consumers in order to serve and satisfy them. Connecting with customers establishes exclusivity in their experience, which potentially will increase brand loyalty, and word of mouth, and provides businesses with valuable consumer analytics, insight, and retention. Customer engagement can come in the form of a view, an impression, a reach, a click, a comment, or a share, among many others. These are ways in which analytics and insights into customer engagement can now be measured on different levels, all of which are information that allows businesses to record and process results of customer engagement.\nTaking into consideration the widespread information and connections for consumers, the way to develop penetrable customer engagement is to proactively connect with customers by listening. Listening will empower the consumer, give them control, and endorse a customer-centric two-way dialogue. This dialogue will redefine the role of the consumer as they no longer assume the end user role in the process. Instead of the traditional transaction and/or exchange, the concept becomes a process of partnership between organizations and consumers. Particularly since the internet has provided consumers with the accumulation of much diverse knowledge and understanding, consumers now have increasingly high expectations, stronger sensory perceptions, and hence have become more attracted to experiential values. Therefore, it would only be profitable for businesses to submit to the new criteria, to provide the opportunity for consumers to further immerse in the consumption experience. This experience will involve organizations and consumers sharing and exchanging information, which will generate increased awareness, interest, desire to purchase, retention, and loyalty among consumers, evolving an intimate relationship. Significantly, total openness and strengthening customer service is the selling point here for customers, to make them feel more involved rather than just a number. This will earn trust, engagement, and ultimately word of mouth through endless social circles. Essentially, it is a more dynamic and transparent concept of customer relationship management (CRM).\n\n\n== Customer engagement on social media ==\nThe utilization of social media platforms has emerged as a modern way of improving customer engagement strategies. By curating content that resonates with the interests of customers, businesses cultivate authentic connections and communities online. Platforms such as Instagram and Twitter serve as useful tools for meaning dialog, enabling businesses to make lasting relationships with customers and amplify brand visibility online. \nCustomer engagement on Twitter is a form of social power and is usually measured with likes, replies and retweets.\n\n\n== Marketing value ==\nCustomer engagement marketing is necessitated by a combination of social, technological and market developments. Companies attempt to create an engaging dialogue with target consumers and stimulate their engagement with the given brand. Although this must take place both on and off-line, the internet is considered the primary method. Marketing begins with understanding the internal dynamics of these developments and the behaviour and engagement of consumers online. Consumer-generated media plays a significant role in the understanding and modeling of engagement. The control Web 2.0 consumers have gained is quantified through 'old school' marketing performance metrics.\nThe effectiveness of the traditional 'interrupt and repeat' model of advertising is decreasing, which has caused businesses to lose control of communications agendas. In August 2006, McKinsey & Co published a report which indicated that traditional TV advertising would decrease in effectiveness compared to previous decades. As customer audiences have become smaller and more specialised, the fragmentation of media, audiences and the accompanying reduction of audience size have reduced the effectiveness of the traditional top-down, mass, 'interrupt and repeat' advertising model. A Forrester Research's North American Consumer Technology Adoption Study found that people in the 18-26 age group spend more time online than watching TV. Furthermore, the Global Web Index reported that in 2021, YouTube beats any mainstream media platforms when it comes to monthly engagement. This is partly due to the fact that 51% of U.S. and U.K. consumers use YouTube for shopping and product research, a service that traditional media can't really provide.\nIn response to the fragmentation and increased amount of time spent online, marketers have also increased spending in online communication. ContextWeb analysts found marketers who promote on sites like Facebook and New York Times are not as successful at reaching consumers while marketers who promote more on niche websites have a better chance of reaching their audiences. Customer audiences are also broadcasters with the power for circulation and permanence of CGM, businesses lose influence. Rather than trying to position a product using static messages, companies can become the subject of conversation amongst a target market that has already discussed, positioned and rated the product. This also means that consumers can now choose not only when and how but, also, if they will engage with marketing communications. In addition, new media provides consumers with more control over advertising consumption.\nResearch shows the importance of customer engagement in the modern market. The lowering of entry barriers, such as the need for a sales force, access to channels and physical assets, and the geographical widening of the market due to the internet have brought about increasing competition and a decrease in brand loyalty. In combination with lower switching costs, easier access to information about products and suppliers and increased choice, brand loyalty is hard to achieve. The increasing ineffectiveness of television advertising is due to the shift of consumer attention to the internet and new media, which controls advertising consumption and causes a decrease in audience size. A study conducted by Salesforce shows an overwhelming 8% of customers acknowledge that their experience with the business is equivalent to the quality of its products or services. Therefore, it is important to prioritize customer engagement as a business strategy. \nThe proliferation of media that provide consumers with more control over their advertising consumption (subscription-based digital radio and TV) and the simultaneous decrease of trust in advertising and increase of trust in peers point to the need for communications that the customer will desire to engage with. Stimulating a consumer's engagement with a brand is the only way to increase brand loyalty and, therefore, \"the best measure of current and future performance\".\n\n\n== Consumer behavior ==\nCE behaviour became prominent with the advent of the social phenomenon of online CE. Creating and stimulating customer engagement behaviour has recently become an explicit aim of both profit and non-profit organisations in the belief that engaging target customers to a high degree is conducive to furthering business objectives.\nShevlin's definition of CE is well suited to understanding the process that leads to an engaged customer. In its adaptation by Richard Sedley the key word is 'investment'. \"Repeated interactions that strengthen the emotional, psychological or physical investment a customer has in a brand.\"\nA customer's degree of engagement with a company lies in a continuum that represents the strength of his investment in that company. Positive experiences with the company strengthen that investment and move the customer down the line of engagement.\nWhat is important in measuring degrees of involvement is the ability of defining and quantifying the stages on the continuum. One popular suggestion is a four-level model adapted from Kirkpatrick's Levels:\n\nClick – A reader arrived (current metric)\nConsume – A reader read the content\nUnderstood – A reader understood the content and remembers it\nApplied – A reader applies the content in another venue\nConcerns have, however, been expressed as regards the measurability of stages three and four.  Another popular suggestion is Ghuneim's typology of engagement.\n\nThe following consumer typology according to degree of engagement fits also into Ghuneim's continuum: creators (smallest group), critics, collectors, couch potatoes (largest group).\nEngagement is a holistic characterization of a consumer's behavior, encompassing a host of sub-aspects of behaviour such as loyalty, satisfaction, involvement, word-of-mouth advertising, complaining and more.\n\nSatisfaction: Satisfaction is simply the foundation, and the minimum requirement, for a continuing relationship with customers. Engagement extends beyond mere satisfaction.\nLoyalty – Retention: Highly engaged consumers are more loyal. Increasing the engagement of target customers increases the rate of customer retention.\nWord-of-mouth advertising – advocacy: Highly engaged customers are more likely to engage in free (for the company), credible (for their audience) word-of-mouth advertising. This can drive new customer acquisition and can have viral effects.\nAwareness – Effectiveness of communications: When customers are exposed to communication from a company that they are highly engaged with, they tend to actively elaborate on its central idea. This brings about high degrees of central processing and recall.\nFiltering: Consumers filter, categorize and rate the market from head to tail, creating multiple, overlapping folksonomies through tagging, reviewing, rating and recommending.\nComplaint-behaviour: Highly engaged customers are less likely to complain to other current or potential customers, but will address the company directly instead.\nMarketing intelligence: Highly engaged customers can give valuable recommendations for improving the quality of the offering.\nThe behavioural outcomes of an engaged consumer are what links CE to profits. From this point of view,\n\"CE is the best measure of current and future performance; an engaged relationship is probably the only guarantee for a return on your organization's or your clients' objectives.\" Simply attaining a high level of customer satisfaction does not seem to guarantee the customer's business. 60% to 80% of customers who defect to a competitor said they were satisfied or very satisfied on the survey just prior to their defection.\nThe main difference between traditional and customer engagement marketing is marked by these shifts:\n\nFrom 'reach or awareness focused' marketing communications and their metrics (GRP or pageview) towards more targeted and customised interactions that prompt the consumer to engage with and act on the content from the outset.\nFrom absolute distinctions and barriers between an organisation and its target customers towards the participation of consumers in product development, customer service and other aspects of the brand experience.\nFrom one-way, top-down, formal B2C and B2E interaction to continuing, dialogic, decentralised and personalised communications initiated by either party.\nSpecific marketing practices involve:\n\nEncouraging collaborative filtering: Google, Amazon, iTunes, Yahoo LAUNCHcast, Netflix, and Rhapsody encourage their consumers to filter, categorise and rate; that is, to market their products. They realise consumers are not only much more adept at creating highly targeted taxonomies (folksonomies) given that they are more adept at delineating the segment they themselves constitute, but, also, that they are willing to do so for free. And to the extent they cannot, they do it for them. If enough people like the band Groove Armada as well as the band The Crystal Method, there may well be a stylistic connection between them, despite the fact that one's categorised as 'downtempo' and the other 'beats and breaks'. Such strong associations tell Yahoo! to put the two on the same playlist more often, and if the positive ratings continue to come in, that connection is reinforced. Amazon does the same with their ‘customers who bought this item also bought…’ recommendations.\nCommunity development: Helping target customers develop their own communities or create new ones.\nCommunity participation: (See Communal marketing) Consumers do not filter and rate companies and their offerings within company websites only. Being able, with little effort, cost or technical skills, to create their own online localities, a large percentage of the filtering and rating takes place in non-sponsored, online spaces. Organisations must go and meet their target customers at their favoured online hangouts to not only listen but also participate in the dialogue.\nHelp consumers engage with one another: Give them content (viral podcasting, videocasting, games, v-cards etc.) they can use to engage with one another.\nSolicitation of user generated content: Engage them directly or indirectly with your product by giving them the means or incentive to create user generated content.\nCustomer self-service: Help them create a customer service FAQ in wiki or blog format. Create a blog where technical support staff and customers can communicate directly.\nProduct co-development: Create a blog where product developers and consumers can communicate directly.\nLeading by teaching: Help customers in product selection by first teaching them practically, showing them a video about product use and then help them to select the product.\n\n\n== Metrics ==\nAll marketing practices, including internet marketing, include measuring the effectiveness of various media along the customer engagement cycle, as consumers travel from awareness to purchase. Often the use of CVP Analysis factors into strategy decisions, including budgets and media placement.\nThe CE metric is useful for:\na) Planning:\n\nIdentify where CE-marketing efforts should take place; which of the communities that the target customers participate in are the most engaging?\nSpecify the way in which target customers engage, or want to engage, with the company or offering.\nb) Measuring Effectiveness: Measure how successful CE-marketing efforts have been at engaging target customers.\nThe importance of CE as a marketing metric is reflected in ARF's statement:\n\"The industry is moving toward customer engagement with marketing communications as the 21st century metric of marketing efficiency and effectiveness.\"\nARF envisages CE exclusively as a metric of engagement with communication, but it is not necessary to distinguish between engaging with the communication and with the product since CE behaviour deals with, and is influenced by, involvement with both.\nIn order to be operational, CE-metrics must be combined with psychodemographics. It is not enough to know that a website has 500 highly engaged members, for instance; it is imperative to know what percentage are members of the company's target market. As a metric for effectiveness, Scott Karp suggests, CE is the solution to the same intractable problems that have long been a struggle for old media: how to prove value.\nThe CE-metric is synthetic and integrates a number of variables. The World Federation of Advertisers calls it 'consumer-centric holistic measurement'. The following items have all been proposed as components of a CE-metric:\nRoot metrics\n\nDuration of visit\nFrequency of visit (returning to the site directly – through a URL or bookmark – or indirectly).\n% repeat visits\nRecency of visit\nDepth of visit (% of site visited)\nClick-through rate\nSales\nLifetime value\nAction metrics\n\nRSS feed subscriptions\nBookmarks, tags, ratings\nViewing of high-value or medium-value content (as valued from the organisation's point-of-view). 'Depth' of visit can be combined with this variable.\nInquiries\nProviding personal information\nDownloads\nContent resyndication\nCustomer reviews\nComments: their quality is another indicator of the degree of engagement.\nRatio between posts and comments plus trackbacks.\nIn selecting the components of a CE-metric, the following issues must be resolved:\n\nFlexible metric vs. Industry standard: According to some, CE \"measurement has never been one size fits-all\" but should vary according to industry, organisation, business goal etc. On the other hand, corporate clients and even agencies also desire some type of solid index. Internal metrics could, perhaps, be developed in addition to a comparative, industry-wide one.\nRelative weighting: The relative weighting associated with each CE-component in an algorithm. For instance, is subscribing to RSS more important than contributing a comment? If yes how much more important exactly? Relative weighting links up with the issue of flexible vs. standardised metrics: Is the relative weighting going to be solid – as will be required if the CE-metric is to be standardised – or is it going to differ depending on the industry, organisation, business goals etc.?\nComponent measurability: Most of the components of a CE-metric face problems of measurement. Duration of visit for example suffers from (a) failing to capture the most engaged users who like to peruse RSS feeds; (b) inaccuracy arising from leaving a tab open during breaks, stopping to converse with co-workers, etc.\nLength of measurement: For how long must the various CE components be measured if CE is to reflect loyalty rather than short-term, faddish engagement?\n\n\n== See also ==\nActive users\nMarketing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCheung, Christy M.K.; Shen, Xiao-Liang; Lee, Zach W.Y.; Chan, Tommy K.H.

        "content": "Customer relationship management (CRM) is a strategic process that organizations use to manage, analyze, and improve their interactions with customers. By using data-driven insights, CRM helps businesses optimize communication, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable growth.\nCRM systems compile data from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone (which many services come with a softphone), email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media. They allow businesses to learn more about their target audiences and how to better cater to their needs, thus retaining customers and driving sales growth. CRM may be used with past, present or potential customers. The concepts, procedures, and rules that a corporation follows when communicating with its consumers are referred to as CRM. This complete connection covers direct contact with customers, such as sales and service-related operations, forecasting, and the analysis of consumer patterns and behaviours, from the perspective of the company.\nThe global customer relationship management market size is projected to grow from $101.41 billion in 2024 to $262.74 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 12.6% \n\n\n== History ==\nThe concept of customer relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking. At that time, businesses had to rely on standalone mainframe systems to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in spreadsheets and lists. One of the best-known precursors of modern-day CRM is the Farley File. Developed by Franklin Roosevelt's campaign manager, James Farley, the Farley File was a comprehensive set of records detailing political and personal facts about people FDR and Farley met or were supposed to meet. Using it, people that FDR met were impressed by his \"recall\" of facts about their family and what they were doing professionally and politically. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestenbaum introduced the concept of database marketing, namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data. By 1987, Pat Sullivan and Mike Muhney had released a customer evaluation system called ACT! based on the principle of a digital Rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.\nThe trend was followed by numerous companies and independent developers trying to maximize lead potential, including Tom Siebel of Siebel Systems, who designed the first CRM product, Siebel Customer Relationship Management, in 1993. In order to compete with these new and quickly growing stand-alone CRM solutions, established enterprise resource planning (ERP) software companies like Oracle, Zoho Corporation, SAP, Peoplesoft (an Oracle subsidiary as of 2005) and Navision started extending their sales, distribution and customer service capabilities with embedded CRM modules. This included embedding sales force automation or extended customer service (e.g. inquiry, activity management) as CRM features in their ERP.\nCustomer relationship management was popularized in 1997 due to the work of Siebel, Gartner, and IBM. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with shipping and marketing capabilities. Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a stand-alone, cloud-hosted customer base was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including PeopleSoft (acquired by Oracle), Oracle, SAP and Salesforce.com.\nThe first open-source CRM system was developed by SugarCRM in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to the cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction. Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favourite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively social CRM solutions, including Base and Nutshell. The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions. In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business. In November 2016, Forrester released a report where it \"identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors\".\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== Strategic ===\nStrategic CRM concentrates upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.\nThe focus of a business on being customer-centric (in design and implementation of their CRM strategy) will translate into an improved CLV.\n\n\n=== Operational ===\nThe primary goal of CRM systems is integration and automation of sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a single customer view, a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of three main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.\n\nSales force automation works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client. It implements sales promotion analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties.\nMarketing automation focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on customer engagement through social media.\nService automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.\n\n\n=== Analytical ===\nThe role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions. Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently. For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After reviewing their data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.\n\n\n=== Collaborative ===\nThe third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organizations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.\n\n\n=== Customer data platform ===\n\nA customer data platform (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.  As of February 2017, about twenty companies were selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300 million.\n\n\n== Components ==\n\nThe main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of the value of a relationship to the firm is not homogeneous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of their marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgment of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. By studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.\nRelational Intelligence, which is the awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm and the ability of the firm to reinforce or change those connections, is an important component of the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing demographic data, such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into profitability tiers, but this is only a firm's industrial view of customer relationships. A lack of relational intelligence is a sign that firms still see customers as resources that can be used for up-sell or cross-sell opportunities, rather than people looking for interesting and personalized interactions.\nCRM systems include:\n\nData warehouse technology, which is used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.\nOpportunity management, which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.\nCRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.\nSome CRM software is available as a software as a service (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.\nFor small businesses, a CRM system may consist of a contact management system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts. CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial return on investment (ROI).\nCRM systems for eCommerce focus on marketing automation tasks such as cart rescue, re-engaging users with email, and personalization.\nCustomer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.\nSystems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.\nCRM not only indicates technology and strategy but also indicates an integrated approach that includes employees knowledge and organizational culture to embrace the CRM philosophy.\n\n\n== Effect on customer satisfaction ==\nCustomer satisfaction has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection. The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to affect customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.\nFirstly, firms can customize their offerings for each customer. By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers. This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because the perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts. For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service experience across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction. CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.\n\n\n=== Customer benefits ===\nWith CRM systems, customers are served on the day-to-day process. With more reliable information, their demand for self-service from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, then the customer satisfaction level is expected to increase. These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity, which are relationship, value, and brand, and in the end to customer equity. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.\n\nEnhanced ability to target profitable customers.\nIntegrated assistance across channels.\nEnhanced sales force efficiency and effectiveness.\nImproved pricing.\nCustomized products and services.\nImproved customer service efficiency and effectiveness.\nIndividualized marketing messages are also called campaigns.\nConnect customers and all channels on a single platform.\n\n\n=== Examples ===\nResearch has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance. Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, MBNA Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above the industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.\nAmazon has also seen successes through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.\n\n\n== Customer profile ==\n\nA customer profile is a detailed description of any particular classification of customer which is created to represent the typical users of a product or service. Customer profiling is a method to understand your customers in terms of demographics, behaviour and lifestyle. It is used to help make customer-focused decisions without confusing the scope of the project with personal opinion. Overall profiling is gathering information that sums up consumption habits so far and projects them into the future so that they can be grouped for marketing and advertising purposes.\nCustomer or consumer profiles are the essences of the data that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through customer analytics methods, essentially a type of profiling. \nThe three basic methods of customer profiling are the psychographic approach, the consumer typology approach, and the consumer characteristics approach. These customer profiling methods help you design your business around who your customers are and help you make better customer-centered decisions.\n\n\n== Improving CRM ==\nConsultants hold that it is important for companies to establish strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence. According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars, and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate, or anything in between.\n\n\n=== Data analysis ===\nManagers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can collect this information by using surveys, interviews, and more, with current customers. \nCompanies must also improve the relational intelligence of their CRM systems. Companies store and receive huge amounts of data through emails, online chat sessions, phone calls, and more. Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence. Companies can use data mining technologies and web searches to understand relational signals. Social media such as social networking sites, blogs, and forums can also be used to collect and analyze information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customers' signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.\n\n\n=== Employee training ===\nMany firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and create strong customer-brand relationships. Other employees have also been trained in social psychology and the social sciences to help bolster customer relationships. Customer service representatives must be trained to value customer relationships and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.\n\n\n== In practice ==\n\n\n=== Call centers ===\nContact centre CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between the company and customers by using analytics and key performance indicators to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize average revenue per user, decrease churn rate and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.\nGrowing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.\nGamification tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.\n\n\n=== Contact-center automation ===\nContact-center automation,  CCA, the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question. Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.\n\n\n=== Social media ===\nSocial CRM involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers. Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand. With the increase in the use of social media platforms, integrating CRM with the help of social media can potentially be a quicker and more cost-friendly process.\nSome CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.\nEnterprise feedback management software platforms combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.\n\n\n=== Location-based services ===\nCRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.\n\n\n=== Business-to-business transactions ===\nDespite the general notion that CRM systems were created for customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.\nThe main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.\n\n\n== Market trends ==\n\n\n=== Social networking ===\nIn the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like \"system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites\" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.\nThe era of the \"social customer\" refers to the use of social media by customers.\n\n\n=== Mobile ===\nSome CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.\n\n\n=== Cloud computing and SaaS ===\nMany CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools (cloud computing) and SaaS. Salesforce.com was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position. Over the years, the number of SaaS providers has grown with CRM being the leading category for 2024.\nTraditional providers moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: Oracle purchased RightNow in October 2011, and Taleo and Eloqua in 2012; SAP acquired SuccessFactors in December 2011 and NetSuite acquired Verenia in 2022.\n\n\n=== Sales and sales force automation ===\nSales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing sales effectiveness and increasing sales productivity is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM software. Some of the top CRM trends identified in 2021 include focusing on customer service automation such as chatbots, hyper-personalization based on customer data and insights, and the use of unified CRM systems. CRM vendors support sales productivity with different products, such as tools that measure the effectiveness of ads that appear in 3D video games.\nPharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.\n\n\n=== Vendor relationship management ===\nAnother related development is vendor relationship management (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of CRM Magazine.\n\n\n=== Customer success ===\nAnother trend worth noting is the rise of Customer Success as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for a more holistic understanding of customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space. As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites.\n\n\n=== AI and predictive analytics ===\nIn 2017, artificial intelligence and predictive analytics were identified as the newest trends in CRM.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\nCompanies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably. They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients may be treated like an exchange party, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan. In 2003, a Gartner report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent. Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis. In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. Forty-three percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems. However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among developing countries' consumers.\nCollection of customer data such as personally identifiable information must strictly obey customer privacy laws, which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.\nPart of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company. The CRM paradox, also referred to as the \"dark side of CRM\", may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers. This can happen because a business prioritizes customers who are more profitable, more relationship-orientated or tend to have increased loyalty to the company. Although focusing on such customers by itself is not a bad thing, it can leave other customers feeling left out and alienated potentially decreasing profits because of it.\nCRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communication with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n Business portal\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Empathy is generally described as the ability to perceive another person's perspective, to understand, feel, and possibly share and respond to their experience. There are other (sometimes conflicting) definitions of empathy that include but are not limited to social, cognitive, and emotional processes primarily concerned with understanding others. Empathy is often considered to be a broad term, and can be divided into more specific concepts and categories, such as cognitive empathy, emotional (or affective) empathy, somatic empathy, and spiritual empathy.\nEmpathy is still a topic being studied. The major areas of research include the development of empathy, the genetics and neuroscience of empathy, cross-species empathy, and the impairment of empathy. Some researchers have attempted to quantify empathy through different methods, such as questionnaires that participants can fill out and then be scored on their answers.\nThe ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions in others may be innate and may be achieved unconsciously. Empathy exists on a spectrum, an individual can be more or less empathetic toward another individual and empirical research supports a variety of interventions that are able to improve empathy.\nThe English word empathy is derived from the Ancient Greek ἐμπάθεια (empatheia, meaning \"physical affection or passion\"). That word derives from ἐν (en, \"in, at\") and πάθος (pathos, \"passion\" or \"suffering\"). Theodor Lipps adapted the German aesthetic term Einfühlung (\"feeling into\") to psychology in 1903, and Edward B. Titchener translated Einfühlung into English as \"empathy\" in 1909. In modern Greek εμπάθεια may mean depending on the context, prejudice, malevolence, malice, or hatred.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nSince its introduction into the English language, empathy has had a wide range of (sometimes conflicting) definitions among both researchers and laypeople. Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of phenomena, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them, experiencing emotions that match another person's, discerning what another person is thinking or feeling, and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.\nSince empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized derives from the way emotions are characterized. For example, if emotions are characterized by bodily feelings, then understanding the bodily feelings of another will be considered central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then understanding those beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy.\nParadigmatically, a person exhibits empathy when they communicate an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that seems accurate and tolerable to the recognized person. This is a nuanced perspective on empathy which assists in the understanding of complex human emotions and interactions. Acknowledging subjective experiences highlights the need for balance and understanding when engaging in empathy.\nOne's ability to recognize the bodily feelings or emotions of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the proprioceptive feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself. \n\n\n=== Distinctions between empathy and related concepts ===\nCompassion and sympathy are terms associated with empathy. A person feels compassion when they notice others are in need, and this feeling motivates that person to help. Like empathy, compassion has a wide range of definitions and purported facets (which overlap with some definitions of empathy). Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an empathic concern for another person, and the wish to see them better off or happier.\nEmpathy is also related to pity and emotional contagion. One feels pity towards others who might be in trouble or in need of help. This feeling is described as \"feeling sorry\" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a mob) imitatively \"catches\" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.\nAlexithymia describes a deficiency in understanding, processing, or describing one's own emotions (unlike empathy which is about someone else's emotions).\n\n\n== Classification ==\nEmpathy has two major components:\n\nAffective empathy, also called emotional empathy, is the ability to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states. Our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion: being affected by another's emotional or arousal state. Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:\nEmpathic concern: sympathy and compassion for others in response to their suffering.\nPersonal distress: feelings of discomfort and anxiety in response to another's suffering. There is no consensus regarding whether personal distress is a form of empathy or instead is something distinct from empathy. There may be a developmental aspect to this subdivision. Infants respond to the distress of others by getting distressed themselves; only when they are two years old do they start to respond in other-oriented ways: trying to help, comfort, and share.\nAffective mentalizing: uses clues like body language, facial expressions, knowledge about the other's beliefs & situation, and context to understand more about what one is empathizing with.\nCognitive empathy is the ability to understand another's perspective or mental state. The terms empathic accuracy, social cognition, perspective-taking, theory of mind, and mentalizing are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent. Although measures of cognitive empathy include self-report questionnaires and behavioral measures, a 2019 meta-analysis found only a negligible association between self-report and behavioral measures, suggesting that people are generally not able to accurately assess their own cognitive empathy abilities. Cognitive empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:\nPerspective-taking: the tendency to spontaneously adopt others' psychological perspectives.\nFantasy: the tendency to identify with fictional characters.\nTactical (or strategic) empathy: the deliberate use of perspective-taking to achieve certain desired ends.\nEmotion regulation: a damper on the emotional contagion process that allows you to empathize without being overwhelmed by the emotion you are empathizing with.\nThe scientific community has not coalesced around a precise definition of these constructs, but there is consensus about this distinction. Affective and cognitive empathy are also independent from one another; someone who strongly empathizes emotionally is not necessarily good in understanding another's perspective.\nAdditional constructs that have been proposed include behavioral empathy (which governs how one chooses to respond to feelings of empathy), social empathy (in which the empathetic person integrates their understanding of broader social dynamics into their empathetic modeling), and ecological empathy (which encompasses empathy directed towards the natural world).\nIn addition, Fritz Breithaupt emphasizes the importance of empathy suppression mechanisms in healthy empathy.\n\n\n=== Empathic anger ===\nEmpathic anger is an emotion, a form of empathic distress. Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing.\nEmpathic anger affects desires to help and to punish. Two sub-categories of empathic anger are state empathic anger (current empathic anger) and trait empathic anger (tendency or predisposition to experience empathic anger).\nThe higher a person's perspective-taking ability, the less angry they are in response to a provocation. Empathic concern does not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress is associated with increased anger.\n\n\n=== Empathic distress ===\n\nEmpathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or guilt. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social; however, views differ as to whether they serve as motives for moral behavior.\nStoic philosophers believed that to condition your emotional disposition on the emotions or fortunes of someone else is foolish. Cicero said that someone who feels distress at another's misfortune is committing as much of an error as an envious person who feels distress at another's good fortune.\n\n\n== Measurement ==\nEfforts to measure empathy go back to at least the mid-twentieth century. Researchers approach the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.\nBehavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters. Other experimenters required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.\nPhysiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced.\nBodily or \"somatic\" measures can be seen as behavioral measures at a micro level. They measure empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions. Such changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of \"emotional contagion\" or mirroring. These reactions, while they appear to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, reflect the results of emotional reactions based on cognitions associated with role-taking (\"if I were him I would feel...\").\nPicture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers. Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a seven-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions.\nIn some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy; scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form.\n\n\n=== Self-report measures ===\nMeasures of empathy also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to reveal the affective, cognitive-affective, or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to reveal both cognitive and affective substrates. However, a 2019 meta analysis questions the validity of self-report measures of cognitive empathy, finding that such self-report measures have negligibly small correlations with corresponding behavioral measures. Balancing subjective self-perceptions along with observable behaviors can help to contribute to a more reliable assessment of empathy.\nSuch measures are also vulnerable to measuring not empathy but the difference between a person's felt empathy and their standards for how much empathy is appropriate. For example, one researcher found that students scored themselves as less empathetic after taking her empathy class. After learning more about empathy, the students became more exacting in how they judged their own feelings and behavior, expected more from themselves, and so rated themselves more severely.\nIn the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP).\nThe Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is among the oldest published measurement tools still in frequent use (first published in 1983) that provides a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four seven-item scales covering the subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy described above. More recent self-report tools include The Empathy Quotient (EQ) created by Baron-Cohen and Wheelwright which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items. Another multi-dimensional scale is the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy (QCAE, first published in 2011).\nThe Empathic Experience Scale is a 30-item questionnaire that measures empathy from a phenomenological perspective on intersubjectivity, which provides a common basis for the perceptual experience (vicarious experience dimension) and a basic cognitive awareness (intuitive understanding dimension) of others' emotional states.\nIt is difficult to make comparisons over time using such questionnaires because of how language changes. For example, one study used a single questionnaire to measure 13,737 college students between 1979 and 2009, and found that empathy scores fell substantially over that time. A critic noted these results could be because the wording of the questionnaire had become anachronistically quaint (it used idioms no longer in common use, like \"tender feelings\", \"ill at ease\", \"quite touched\", or \"go to pieces\" that today's students might not identify with).\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Ontogenetic development ===\nBy the age of two, children normally begin to exhibit fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state. Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy; they understand that, as with their own actions, other people's actions have goals. Toddlers sometimes comfort others or show concern for them. During their second year, they play games of falsehood or pretend in an effort to fool others. Such actions require that the child knows what others believe in order that the child can manipulate those beliefs.\nAccording to researchers at the University of Chicago who used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), children between the ages of seven and twelve, when seeing others being injured, experience brain activity similar that which would occur if the child themself had been injured. Their findings are consistent with previous fMRI studies of pain empathy with adults, and previous findings that vicarious experiencing, particularly of others' distress, is hardwired and present early in life. The research found additional areas of the brain, associated with social and moral cognition, were activated when young people saw another person intentionally hurt by somebody, including regions involved in moral reasoning.\nAlthough children are capable of showing some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most do not demonstrate a full theory of mind until around the age of four. Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy. Children usually can pass false-belief tasks (a test for a theory of mind) around the age of four. It is theorised that people with autism find using a theory of mind to be very difficult, but there is quite a bit of controversy on this subject. (e.g. the Sally–Anne test).\nEmpathic maturity is a cognitive-structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing. It addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Adults who operate with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.\n\n\n=== Individual differences ===\nThe Empathic Concern scale assesses other-oriented feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures self-oriented feelings of personal anxiety and unease. Researchers have used behavioral and neuroimaging data to analyze extraversion and agreeableness. Both are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions that are important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).\n\n\n=== Sex differences ===\n\nOn average, females score higher than males on measures of empathy, such as the Empathy Quotient (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Both males and females with autistic spectrum disorders usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ (see below for more detail on autism and empathy).\nOther studies show no significant sex differences, and instead suggest that gender differences are the result of motivational differences, such as upholding stereotypes. Gender stereotypes about men and women can affect how they express emotions. The sex difference is small to moderate, somewhat inconsistent, and is often influenced by the person's motivations or social environment. Bosson et al. say \"physiological measures of emotion and studies that track people in their daily lives find no consistent sex differences in the experience of emotion\", which \"suggests that women may amplify certain emotional expressions, or men may suppress them\".\nHowever, a 2014 review from Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews reported that there is evidence that \"sex differences in empathy have phylogenetic and ontogenetic roots in biology and are not merely cultural byproducts driven by socialization.\" The review found sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age, and consistent and stable across lifespan. Females, on average, had higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy, regardless of gender, continue to be higher in empathy throughout development. Analysis of brain event-related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males. An investigation of N400 amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations, which positively correlated with self-reported empathy. Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger grey matter volumes in posterior inferior frontal and anterior inferior parietal cortex areas which are correlated with mirror neurons in fMRI literature. Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy. The researchers believe that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by environmental influences but rather by human evolution and inheritance. Throughout prehistory, women were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the \"Primary Caretaker Hypothesis\", prehistoric men did not have such selective pressure as primary caretakers. This might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.\nA review published in Neuropsychologia found that females tended to be better at recognizing facial affects, expression processing, and emotions in general. Males tended to be better at recognizing specific behaviors such as anger, aggression, and threatening cues. A 2014 meta-analysis, in Cognition and Emotion, found a small female advantage in non-verbal emotional recognition.\n\n\n=== Environmental influences ===\nSome research theorizes that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, affect the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro-social relationships and helps mediate aggression.\nCaroline Tisot studied how environmental factors like parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences affect the development of empathy in young children. The children studied were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed a questionnaire to assess parenting style and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale. The study found that certain parenting practices, as opposed to parenting style as a whole, contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was significantly positively related to empathy in children, especially boys. Maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy in children, especially girls.\nEmpathy may be disrupted due to brain trauma such as stroke. In most cases, empathy is impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain. Damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can profoundly impact a person's capacity to experience empathy. People with an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy. More than half of those people with a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.\nThere is some evidence that empathy is a skill that one can improve in with training.\n\n\n=== Evolution across species ===\nStudies in animal behavior and neuroscience indicate that empathy is not restricted to humans (however the interpretation of such research depends in part on how expansive a definition of empathy researchers adopt).\nEmpathy-like behaviors have been observed in primates, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in bonobos, perhaps the most empathic primate.\nOne study demonstrated prosocial behavior elicited by empathy in rodents. Rodents demonstrate empathy for cagemates (but not strangers) in pain.\nAn influential study on the evolution of empathy by Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal discusses a neural perception-action mechanism and postulates a bottom-up model of empathy that ties together all levels, from state matching to perspective-taking.\nUniversity of Chicago neurobiologist Jean Decety agrees that empathy is not exclusive to humans, but that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social attachment, and parental care. Neural circuits involved in empathy and caring include the brainstem, the amygdala, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, insula, and orbitofrontal cortex.\n\n\n== Other animals and empathy between species ==\n\nResearchers Zanna Clay and Frans de Waal studied the socio-emotional development of the bonobo chimpanzee. They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events—events related to themselves (e.g. loss of a fight) as well as stressful events of others. They found that bonobos sought out body contact with one another as a coping mechanism. Bonobos sought out more body contact after watching an event distress other bonobos than after their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos sought out more physical contact than orphaned bonobos after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding in successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors. De Waal suggests the advantages provided to mothers who understand the needs of their children are the reason empathy evolved in the first place.\nEmpathic-like behavior has been observed in chimpanzees in different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in both natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers led by Teresa Romero observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees in two separate outdoor housed groups. Acts of consolation were observed in both groups. This behavior is also found in humans, particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.\nDogs have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards humans. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger. When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes; however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking, and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging, or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could suggest that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, it could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.\nWhen witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens (Gallus gallus domesticus) show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hen's heart rate increased, she sounded vocal alarms, she decreased her personal preening, and her body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if it were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat.\nHumans can empathize with other species. One study of a sample of organisms showed that the strength of human empathic perceptions (and compassionate reactions) toward an organism is negatively correlated with how long ago our species' had a common ancestor. In other words, the more phylogenetically close a species is to us, the more likely we are to feel empathy and compassion towards it.\n\n\n== Genetics ==\nMeasures of empathy show evidence of being genetically influenced. For example, carriers of the deletion variant of ADRA2B show more activation of the amygdala when viewing emotionally arousing images. The gene 5-HTTLPR seems to influence sensitivity to negative emotional information and is also attenuated by the deletion variant of ADRA2b. Carriers of the double G variant of the OXTR gene have better social skills and higher self-esteem. A gene located near LRRN1 on chromosome 3 influences the human ability to read, understand, and respond to emotions in others.\n\n\n=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===\nContemporary neuroscience offers insights into the neural basis of the mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies of mirror neurons attempt to measure the neural basis for human mind-reading and emotion-sharing abilities and thereby to explain the basis of the empathy reaction. People who score high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems. Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. The empathic person mirrors or mimics the emotional response they would expect to feel if they were in the other person's place. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.\nEmpathy involves two interconnected elements: cognitive empathy, which is understanding or recognising the emotions another person is experiencing, and affective empathy, which refers to actually feeling or sharing those emotions yourself. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.\nMeta-analysis of fMRI studies of empathy confirms that different brain areas are activated during affective-perceptual empathy than during cognitive-evaluative empathy. Affective empathy is correlated with increased activity in the insula while cognitive empathy is correlated with activity in the mid cingulate cortex and adjacent dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. A study with patients who experienced different types of brain damage confirmed the distinction between emotional and cognitive empathy. Specifically, the inferior frontal gyrus appears to be responsible for emotional empathy, and the ventromedial prefrontal gyrus seems to mediate cognitive empathy.\nfMRI has been employed to investigate the functional anatomy of empathy. Observing another person's emotional state activates parts of the neuronal network that are involved in processing that same state in oneself, whether it is disgust, touch, or pain. As these emotional states are being observed, the brain is able activate a network of the brain that is involved in empathy. There are two separate systems of the brain involved with the feeling of empathy: a cognitive system and an emotional system. The cognitive system helps an individual understand another's perspective while the emotional system enables our ability to empathize emotionally. The neuronal network that is activated controls the observers response to these emotional states thus prompting an empathetic response.\nThe study of the neural underpinnings of empathy received increased interest following a paper published by S.D. Preston and Frans de Waal after the discovery of mirror neurons in monkeys that fire both when the creature watches another perform an action and when they themselves perform it. Researchers suggest that paying attention to perceiving another individual's state activates neural representations, and that this activation primes or generates the associated autonomic and somatic responses (perception-action coupling), unless inhibited. This mechanism resembles the common coding theory between perception and action.\nAnother study provides evidence of separate neural pathways activating reciprocal suppression in different regions of the brain associated with the performance of \"social\" and \"mechanical\" tasks. These findings suggest that the cognition associated with reasoning about the \"state of another person's mind\" and \"causal/mechanical properties of inanimate objects\" are neurally suppressed from occurring at the same time.\nMirroring-behavior in motor neurons during empathy may help duplicate feelings. Such sympathetic action may afford access to sympathetic feelings and, perhaps, trigger emotions of kindness and forgiveness.\n\n\n== Impairment ==\nA difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. Psychopathy and narcissism are associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas bipolar disorder is associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy. People with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may suffer from impairments in cognitive empathy as well as fluctuating affective empathy, although this topic is controversial. Schizophrenia, too, is associated with deficits in both types of empathy. However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.\nAtypical empathic responses are associated with some personality disorders such as psychopathy, borderline, narcissistic, and schizoid personality disorders; conduct disorder; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; and depersonalization. Sex offenders who had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured abuse of the sort they later committed, felt less affective empathy for their victims.\n\n\n=== Autism and controversy ===\nThe subject of whether autism affects empathy is a controversial and complex area of study. Several different factors are proposed to be at play, such as mirror neurons, alexithymia, and more. The double empathy problem theory proposes that prior studies on autism and empathy may have been misinterpreted and that autistic people show the same levels of empathy towards one another as non-autistic people do.\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often correlated to problems with empathy and social communication skills. However, like ASD itself, these issues are often found to be on a spectrum. The suggestion that people with autism are likely to have issues with personal relationships and empathy is a complex issue that has been addressed in many studies. Various research has been exploring these concepts for more than twenty years.\nCertain studies, like this one from 2004 found connections between ASD and empathy issues. Another study found that empathy problems may be associated to the comorbidity of alexithymia (a struggle to feel emotions) and ASD. However, a more recent study from 2022 found that there were, in fact, no significant differences between the brain sections (medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala) that are associated with empathy.\nAnother study (2023) focusing on ASD and empathy with regards to mirror neurons also reflected on the theory that mirror neurons \"may be dysfunctional in ASD.\" However, as the researchers state, this connection is not clear and although mirror neurons are correlated to ASD, there is no proven causational relationship between dysfunctional mirror neurons and ASD. The study from 2023 might be considered contradictory to an earlier (2006) study on mirror neurons that found that high-functioning autistic children showed reduced mirror neuron activity in the brain's inferior frontal gyrus while imitating and observing emotional expressions in other children who were considered non-autistic.\nThe correlation between ASD and empathy is a focus for researchers and many relevant articles can be found in the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders.\n\n\n=== Psychopathy ===\nPsychopathy is a personality construct partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of remorse and empathy. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD) list antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) and dissocial personality disorder, stating that these have been referred to as or include what is referred to as psychopathy.\nPsychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and sadness), including decreased activation of the fusiform and extrastriate cortical regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy. Studies on children with psychopathic tendencies have also shown such associations. The underlying biological surfaces for processing expressions of happiness are functionally intact in psychopaths, although less responsive than in those of controls. The neuroimaging literature is unclear as to whether deficits are specific to particular emotions such as fear. Some fMRI studies report that emotion perception deficits in psychopathy are pervasive across emotions (positives and negatives).\nOne study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests psychopaths can switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say they do not know how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it might be possible to rehabilitate psychopaths by helping them to activate their \"empathy switch\". Others suggested that it remains unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.\nOne problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and punishment as psychopathy, as these entail suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences. Psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.\nWork conducted by Professor Jean Decety with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and periaqueductal gray parts of the brain, but more activity in the striatum and the insula when compared to control participants. In a second study, individuals with psychopathy exhibited a strong response in pain-affective brain regions when taking an imagine-self perspective, but failed to recruit the neural circuits that were activated in controls during an imagine-other perspective—in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala—which may contribute to their lack of empathic concern.\nResearchers have investigated whether people who have high levels of psychopathy have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but lack the ability to use affective empathy. People who score highly on psychopathy measures are less likely to exhibit affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation, showi",

        "content": "Artificial empathy or computational empathy is the development of AI systems—such as companion robots or virtual agents—that can detect emotions and respond to them in an empathic way.\nAlthough such technology can be perceived as scary or threatening, it could also have a significant advantage over humans for roles in which emotional expression can be important, such as in the health care sector. An April 2023 study found that ChatGPT's \"bedside manners\" were often rated as more empathic than those of doctors. Care-givers who perform emotional labor above and beyond the requirements of paid labor can experience chronic stress or burnout, and can become desensitized to patients. Artificial empathy could also help the socialization of care-givers, or serve as role model for emotional detachment.\nA broader definition of artificial empathy is \"the ability of nonhuman models to predict a person's internal state (e.g., cognitive, affective, physical) given the signals (s)he emits (e.g., facial expression, voice, gesture) or to predict a person's reaction (including, but not limited to internal states) when he or she is exposed to a given set of stimuli (e.g., facial expression, voice, gesture, graphics, music, etc.)\".\n\n\n== Areas of research ==\n\nThere are a variety of philosophical, theoretical, and applicative questions related to artificial empathy. For example:\n\nWhich conditions would have to be met for a robot to respond competently to a human emotion?\nWhat models of empathy can or should be applied to Social and Assistive Robotics?\nMust the interaction of humans with robots imitate affective interaction between humans?\nCan a robot help science learn about affective development of humans? \nWould robots create unforeseen categories of inauthentic relations?\nWhat relations with robots can be considered authentic?\nHow can we assess artificial empathy in AI systems? \n\n\n== Examples of artificial empathy research and practice ==\nPeople often communicate and make decisions based on inferences about each other's internal states (e.g., emotional, cognitive, and physical states) that are in turn based on signals emitted by the person such as facial expression, body gesture, voice, and words. Broadly speaking, artificial empathy focuses on developing non-human models that achieve similar objectives using similar data.\n\n\n=== Streams of artificial empathy research ===\nArtificial empathy has been applied in various research disciplines, including artificial intelligence and business. Two main streams of research in this domain are:\n\nthe use of nonhuman models to predict a person's internal state (e.g., cognitive, affective, physical) given the signals he or she emits (e.g., facial expression, voice, gesture)\nthe use of nonhuman models to predict a person's reaction when he or she is exposed to a given set of stimuli (e.g., facial expression, voice, gesture, graphics, music, etc.).\nResearch on affective computing, such as emotional speech recognition and facial expression detection, falls within the first stream of artificial empathy. Contexts that have been studied include oral interviews, call centers, human-computer interaction, sales pitches, and financial reporting.\nThe second stream of artificial empathy has been researched more in marketing contexts, such as advertising, branding, customer reviews, in-store recommendation systems, movies, and online dating.\n\n\n=== Artificial empathy applications in practice ===\nWith the increasing volume of visual, audio, and text data in commerce, many business applications for artificial empathy have followed. For example, Affectiva analyses viewers' facial expressions from video recordings while they are watching video advertisements in order to optimize the content design of video ads. Software like HireVue, BarRaiser, a hiring intelligence firm, helps firms make recruitment decisions by analyzing audio and video information from candidates' video interviews. Lapetus Solutions develops a model to estimate an individual's longevity, health status, and disease susceptibility from a face photo. Their technology has been applied in the insurance industry.\n\n\n== Artificial empathy and human services ==\nAlthough artificial intelligence cannot yet replace social workers themselves, the technology has been deployed in that field. Florida State University published a study about Artificial Intelligence being used in the human services field. The research used computer algorithms to analyze health records for combinations of risk factors that could predict a future suicide attempt. The article reports, \"machine learning—a future frontier for artificial intelligence—can predict with 80% to 90% accuracy whether someone will attempt suicide as far off as two years into the future. The algorithms become even more accurate as a person's suicide attempt gets closer. For example, the accuracy climbs to 92% one week before a suicide attempt when artificial intelligence focuses on general hospital patients\".\nSuch algorithmic machines can help social workers. Social work operates on a cycle of engagement, assessment, intervention, and evaluation with clients. Earlier assessment for risk of suicide can lead to earlier interventions and prevention, therefore saving lives. The system would learn, analyze, and detect risk factors, alerting the clinician of a patient's suicide risk score (analogous to a patient's cardiovascular risk score). Then, social workers could step in for further assessment and preventive intervention.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArtificial human companion\nArtificial intelligence § Social intelligence\nBlade Runner / Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\nCase-based reasoning\nCommonsense reasoning\nEmotion recognition\nFacial recognition system\nGlossary of artificial intelligence\nHuman–robot interaction\nPepper (robot)\nSoft computing\nEvolutionary computing\nMachine learning\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A startup or start-up is a company or project typically undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses including self-employment and businesses that do not intend to go public, startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo-founder. At the early stages, startups face significant uncertainty and high rates of failure. However, a minority achieve notable success and influence, with some growing into unicorns- private companies valued at over US$1 billion.  It is typically characterized by an innovative stance, a potential for rapid growth, external funding, and vulnerability.\n\n\n== Actions ==\nStartups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The founder of a startup will do the market validation by problem interview, solution interview, and building a minimum viable product (MVP), i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models. The startup process can take a long period of time; hence, sustaining effort is required. Over the long term, sustaining effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes. Having a business plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future. Typically, these plans outline the first three to five years of your business strategy.\n\n\n=== Design principles ===\nModels behind startups presenting as ventures are usually associated with design science. Design science uses design principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas and propositions to design and construct the company's backbone. For example, one of the initial design principles is affordable loss.\n\n\n=== Heuristics and biases in startup actions ===\nBecause of the lack of information, high uncertainty, and the need to make decisions quickly, founders usually use many heuristics and exhibit biases in their leadership decisions.\nEntrepreneurs often become overconfident about their startups and their influence on an outcome (case of the illusion of control). Below are some of the most critical decision biases of entrepreneurs to start up a new business.\n\nOverconfidence: Perceive a subjective certainty higher than the objective accuracy.The gap often leads individuals to overestimate their understanding of complex situations, resulting in decisions that are based more on subjective certainty than on objective facts or accurate information\nIllusion of control: Overemphasize how much skills, instead of chance, improve performance.\nThe law of small numbers: Reach conclusions about a larger population using a limited sample.\nAvailability bias: Make judgments about the probability of events based on how easy it is to think of examples.\nEscalation of commitment: Persist unduly with unsuccessful initiatives or courses of action.\nStartups use several action principles to generate evidence as quickly as possible to reduce the downside effect of decision biases such as an escalation of commitment, overconfidence, and the illusion of control.\n\n\n=== Mentoring ===\nMany entrepreneurs seek feedback from mentors in creating their startups. Mentors guide founders and impart entrepreneurial skills and may increase the self-efficacy of nascent entrepreneurs. Mentoring offers direction for entrepreneurs to enhance their knowledge of how to sustain their assets relating to their status and identity and strengthen their real-time skills.\n\n\n== Principles ==\nThere are many principles in creating a startup. Some of the principles needed are listed below:\n\n\n=== Lean startup ===\nLean startup is a clear set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at a lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it. The empirical test is to de/validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a build–measure–learn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely, it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically, a lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:\n\nfind a problem worth solving, then define a solution\nengage early adopters for market validation\ncontinually test with smaller, faster iterations\nbuild a function, measure customer response, and verify/refute the idea\nevidence-based decisions on when to pivot by changing your plan's course\nmaximize the efforts for speed, learning, and focus\n\n\n=== Market validation ===\nA key principle of startup is to validate the market need before providing a customer-centric product or service to avoid business ideas with weak demand. Market validation can be done in a number of ways, including surveys, cold calling, email responses, word of mouth or through sample research.\n\n\n=== Design thinking ===\nDesign thinking is a human-centered approach to problem-solving that emphasizes empathy, collaboration, and experimentation. It is widely used to deeply understand customers' needs, behaviors, and pain points through immersive engagement and iterative feedback. By placing users at the center of the innovation process, design thinking seeks to uncover insights that can lead to more effective, relevant, and impactful solutions.\nHowever, while design thinking—and its complementary methodology, customer development—aim to reduce assumptions and promote evidence-based innovation, they are not immune to cognitive biases. In fact, both processes can inadvertently reinforce existing biases at multiple stages. For instance, the way problems are framed, the sources of information selected, the questions posed during interviews, and the interpretation of qualitative data can all be influenced by the facilitator’s or team’s preconceived notions.\nThese biases can subtly shape what is observed and how it is understood, potentially leading to solutions that reflect the designers' perspectives more than the users’. As a result, the promise of achieving \"customer empathy\" can be compromised if critical reflection and bias-checking mechanisms are not embedded throughout the process. Therefore, while design thinking is a powerful tool for innovation, its effectiveness depends heavily on the rigor, objectivity, and self-awareness of the individuals applying it. Encouraging people to consider the opposite of whatever decision they are about to make tends to reduce biases such as overconfidence, the hindsight bias, and anchoring.\n\n\n=== Decision-making under uncertainty ===\nIn startups, many decisions are made under uncertainty, and hence a key principle for startups is to be agile and flexible. Founders can embed options to design startups in flexible manners, so that the startups can change easily in future.\nUncertainty can vary within-person (I feel more uncertain this year than last year) and between-person (he feels more uncertain than she does). A study found that when entrepreneurs feel more uncertain, they identify more opportunities (within-person difference), but entrepreneurs who perceive more uncertainties than others do not identify more opportunities than others do (no between-person difference).\n\n\n=== Partnering ===\nStartups may form partnerships with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products with the market situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The inheritor profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market with a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this, profile is the originator which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention to be able to find and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner, a startup has greater chances of success.\nStartups usually need many different partners to realize their business idea. The commercialization process is often a bumpy road with iterations and new insights during the process. Hasche and Linton argue that startups can learn from their relationships with other firms, and even if the relationship ends, the startup will have gained valuable knowledge about how it should move on going forward. When a relationship is failing for a startup it needs to make changes. Three types of changes can be identified according to Hasche and Linton:\n\nChange of business concept for the start up\nChange of collaboration constellation (change several relationships)\nChange of characteristic of business relationship (with the partner, e.g. from a transactional relationship to more of a collaborative type of relationship)\n\n\n=== Entrepreneurial learning ===\n\nStartups need to learn at a huge speed before running out of resources. Proactive actions (experimentation, searching, etc.) enhance a founder's learning to start a company. To learn effectively, founders often formulate falsifiable hypotheses, build a minimum viable product (MVP), and conduct A/B testing.\n\n\n=== Business model design ===\nWith the key learnings from market validation, design thinking, and lean startup, founders can design a business model. However it is important not to dive into business models too early before there is sufficient learning on market validation. Paul Graham said: \"What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don't do that, it won't matter how clever your business model is.\"\n\n\n== Founders/entrepreneurs ==\n\nFounders or co-founders are people involved in the initial launch of startup companies. Three people are mainly required as co-founders to create a powerful team: the product person (e.g. an engineer), a marketing person (for market research, customer interaction, vision) and a finance or operation's person (to handle operations or raise funds).\nThe founder that is responsible for the overall strategy of the startup plays the role of founder-CEOs, much like CEOs in established firms. Startup studios provide an opportunity for founders and team members to grow along with the business they help to build. In order to create forward momentum, founders must ensure that they provide opportunities for their team members to grow and evolve within the company.\nThe language of securities regulation in the United States considers co-founders to be promoters under Regulation D. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition of promoter includes: (i) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer; However, not every promoter is a co-founder. In fact, there is no formal, legal definition of what makes somebody a co-founder. The right to call oneself a co-founder can be established through an agreement with one's fellow co-founders or with permission of the board of directors, investors, or shareholders of a startup company. When there is no definitive agreement (like shareholders' agreement), disputes about who the co-founders are, can arise.\n\n\n=== Self-efficacy ===\nSelf-efficacy refers to the confidence an individual has to create a new business or startup. It has a strong relation with startup actions. Entrepreneurs' sense of self-efficacy can play a major role in how they approach goals, tasks, and challenges. Entrepreneurs with high self-efficacy—that is, those who believe they can perform well—are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be mastered rather than something to be avoided.\n\n\n=== Stress ===\n\nEntrepreneurs often feel stressed. They have internal and external pressures. Internally, they need to meet deadlines to develop the prototypes and get the product or service ready for market. Externally they are expected to meet milestones of investors and other stakeholders to ensure continued resources from them on the startups. Coping with stress is critical to entrepreneurs because of the stressful nature of starting up a new firm under uncertainty. Coping with stress unsuccessfully could lead to emotional exhaustion, and the founders may close or exit the startups.\n\n\n=== Emotional exhaustion ===\nSustaining effort is required as the startup process can take a long period of time, by one estimate, three years or longer. Sustaining effort over the long term is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes.\n\n\n=== Founder identity and culture ===\nSome startup founders have a more casual or offbeat attitude in their dress, office space and marketing, as compared to executives in established corporations. For example, startup founders in the 2010s wore hoodies, sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings. Their offices may have recreational facilities in them, such as pool tables, ping pong tables, football tables and pinball machines, which are used to create a fun work environment, stimulate team development and team spirit, and encourage creativity. Some of the casual approaches, such as the use of \"flat\" organizational structures, in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally, are done to promote efficiency in the workplace, which is needed to get their business off the ground.\nIn a 1960 study, Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary because some people are born with the motivation to work without incentives. Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure, with executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Some startups offer employees incentives such as stock options, to increase their \"buy in\" from the start up (as these employees stand to gain if the company does well). This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them, and more on achieving the task at hand, giving them the potential to achieve something great for both themselves and their company.\n\n\n== Failure ==\nThe failure rate of startup companies is very high. Analysts continue to report very high startup failure rates. While a 2014 Fortune article estimated that 90% fail, more recent analyses indicate that about 65–80% of startups fail within five years, depending on industry and geography. In the UK, for example, startups (companies in their first seven years) accounted for 46% of all company insolvencies in 2024—the lowest proportion in over a decade, according to PwC. In a sample of 101 unsuccessful startups, companies reported that experiencing one or more of five common factors were the reason for failure; the lack of consumer interest in the product or service (42% of failures), funding or cash problems (29%), personnel or staffing problems (23%), competition from rival companies (19%) and problems with pricing of the product or service (18%). In cases of funding problems, it can leave employees without paychecks. Sometimes, these companies are purchased by other companies if they are deemed to be viable, but oftentimes, they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time. More than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. These common mistakes and missteps that happen early in the startup journey can result in failure, but there are precautions entrepreneurs can take to help mitigate risk. For example, startup studios offer a buffer against many of the obstacles that solo entrepreneurs face, such as funding and insufficient team structure, making them a good resource for startups in their earliest phases. Another large study of 160.000 failed companies, identified key factors such as a dysfunctional founding team, a poor business plan, or just a flawed product-market fit as examples of the primary sources of failure.\nThe lack of human and financial resources or even dedicated patent attorneys in the early stages of a startup makes it difficult to compete with larger companies, and likewise increases the time and reduces the probability of patent applications.\n\n\n=== Re-starters ===\nFailed entrepreneurs, or restarters, who after some time restart in the same sector with more or less the same activities, have an increased chance  of becoming a better entrepreneur. However, some studies indicate that restarters are more heavily discouraged in Europe than in the US.\n\n\n== Training ==\n\nMany institutions and universities provide training on startups. In the context of universities, some of the courses are entrepreneurship courses that also deal with the topic of startups, while other courses are specifically dedicated to startups. Startup courses are found both in traditional economic or business disciplines as well as the side of information technology disciplines. As startups are often focused on software, they are also occasionally taught while focusing on software development alongside the business aspects of a startup.\nFounders go through a lot to set up a startup. A startup requires patience and resilience, and training programs need to have both the business components and the psychological components. Entrepreneurship education is effective in increasing the entrepreneurial attitudes and perceived behavioral control, helping people and their businesses grow. Most of startup training falls into the mode of experiential learning, in which students are exposed to a large extent to a real-life entrepreneurship context as new venture teams. An example of group-based experiential startup training is the Lean LaunchPad initiative that applies the principles of customer development and Lean Startup to technology-based startup projects.\nAs startups are typically thought to operate under a notable lack of resources, have little or no operating history, and to consist of individuals with little practical experience, it is possible to simulate startups in a classroom setting with reasonable accuracy. In fact, it is not uncommon for students to actually participate in real startups during and after their studies. Similarly, university courses teaching software startup themes often have students found mock-up startups during the courses and encourage them to make them into real startups should they wish to do so. Such mock-up startups, however, may not be enough to accurately simulate real-world startup practice if the challenges typically faced by startups (e.g. lack of funding to keep operating) are not present in the course setting.\nTo date, much of the entrepreneurship training is yet to be personalized to match the participants and the training.\n\n\n== Ecosystem ==\n\nThe size and maturity of the startup ecosystem is where a startup is launched and where it grows to have an effect on the volume and success of the startups. The startup ecosystem consists of the individuals (entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors, mentors, advisors); institutions and organizations (top research universities and institutes, business schools and entrepreneurship programs and centres operated by universities and colleges, non-profit entrepreneurship support organizations, government entrepreneurship programs and services, Chambers of commerce) business incubators and business accelerators and top-performing entrepreneurial firms and startups. A region with all of these elements is considered to be a \"strong\" startup ecosystem.\nOne of the most famous startup ecosystems is Silicon Valley in California, where major computer and internet firms and top universities such as Stanford University create a stimulating startup environment. Boston (where Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located) and Berlin, home of WISTA (a top research area), also have numerous creative industries, leading entrepreneurs and startup firms. Basically, attempts are being made worldwide, for example in Israel with its Silicon Wadi, in France with the Inovallée or in Italy in Trieste with the AREA Science Park, to network basic research, universities and technology parks in order to create a startup-friendly ecosystem.\nAlthough there are startups created in all types of businesses, and all over the world, some locations and business sectors are particularly associated with startup companies. The internet bubble of the late 1990s was associated with huge numbers of internet startup companies, some selling the technology to provide internet access, others using the internet to provide services. Most of this startup activity was located in the most well-known startup ecosystem - Silicon Valley, an area of northern California renowned for the high level of startup company activity:\n\nThe spark that set off the explosive boom of \"Silicon startups\" in Stanford Industrial Park was a personal dispute in 1957 between employees of Shockley Semiconductor and the company's namesake and founder, Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor William Shockley... (His employees) formed Fairchild Semiconductor immediately following their departure...\nAfter several years, Fairchild gained its footing, becoming a formidable presence in this sector. Its founders began leaving to start companies based on their own latest ideas and were followed on this path by their own former leading employees... The process gained momentum and what had once begun in a Stanford's research park became a veritable startup avalanche... Thus, over the course of just 20 years, a mere eight of Shockley's former employees gave forth 65 new enterprises, which then went on to do the same... \nStartup advocates are also trying to build a community of tech startups in New York City with organizations like NY Tech Meet Up and Built in NYC. In the early 2000s, the patent assets of failed startup companies were being purchased by people known as patent trolls, who assert those patents against companies that might be infringing the technology covered by the patents.\n\n\n== Investing ==\n\nStartup investing is the action of making an investment in an early-stage company. Beyond founders' own contributions, some startups raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising. Venture Capital is a subdivision of Private Equity wherein external investors fund small-scale startups that have high growth potential in the long run. Venture capital is the money of invention that is invested into young businesses which hold no historic background. Usually, the business of venture capital is highly risky but one can at the same time expect high returns as well.\nIn the United States, the solicitation of funds became easier for startups as result of the JOBS Act. Prior to the advent of equity crowdfunding, a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations, startups did not advertise themselves to the general public as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) that typically involved a listing of the startup's securities on a stock exchange. Today, there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by startups and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing, so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations, including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual discussion of business conditions by management that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies.\nOver the last decade, Europe has developed a rapid start-up scene that has given birth to global players, including more than 70 unicorns, and has created more than two million jobs. Investment in European start-ups increased sixfold between 2010 and 2020, reaching approximately €40 billion. Europe does a poorer job of nurturing young companies because of a failure to support their development into industry leaders. Promising European start-ups then struggle to raise the necessary capital to expand and mature. They are forced to either relocate to the US's deep capital markets or sell themselves to larger rivals with more financial availability. As a result, start-ups in the United States can typically raise far more money—up to five times as much as in Europe.\nInvestors are generally most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co-founding team, a balanced \"risk/reward\" profile (in which high risk due to the untested, disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns) and \"scalability\" (the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers). Attractive startups generally have lower \"bootstrapping\" (self-funding of startups by the founders) costs, higher risk, and higher potential return on investment. Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business, in the sense that the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital, labor or land. Timing has often been the single most important factor for biggest startup successes, while at the same time it is identified to be one of the hardest things to master by many serial entrepreneurs and investors.\nStartups have several options for funding. Revenue-based financing lenders can help startup companies by providing non-dilutive growth capital in exchange for a percentage of monthly revenue. Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging seed money for an equity stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the startups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using \"bootstrapping\", in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit card debt to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet.\nStartups can receive funding via more involved stakeholders, such as startup studios. Startup studios provide funding to support the business through a successful launch, but they also provide extensive operational support, such as HR, finance and accounting, marketing, and product development, to increase the probability of success and propel growth.\nStartup are funded through preset rounds, depending on their funding requirement and the stage of growth of the company. Startup investing is generally divided into six stage, namely\n\nAngel funding\nSeed Funding\nPre-Series A\nSeries B\nSeries C,D\nSeries E, F and Beyond \n\n\n=== Necessity of funding ===\nWhile some (would-be) entrepreneurs believe that they can't start a company without funding from VC, Angel, etc. that is not the case. In fact, many entrepreneurs have founded successful businesses for almost no capital, including the founders of MailChimp, Shopify, and ShutterStock.\n\n\n=== Valuations ===\nIf a company's value is based on its technology, it is often equally important for the business owners to obtain intellectual property protection for their idea. The newsmagazine The Economist estimated that up to 75% of the value of US public companies is now based on their intellectual property (up from 40% in 1980). Often, 100% of a small startup company's value is based on its intellectual property. As such, it is important for technology-oriented startup companies to develop a sound strategy for protecting their intellectual capital as early as possible. Startup companies, particularly those associated with new technology, sometimes produce huge returns to their creators and investors—a recent example of such is Google, whose creators became billionaires through their stock ownership and options.\n\n\n=== Investing rounds ===\nWhen investing in a startup, there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate. The first round is called seed round. The seed round generally is when the startup is still in the very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase. There is likely no performance data or positive financials as of yet. Therefore, investors rely on strength of the idea and the team in place. At this level, family friends and angel investors will be the ones participating. At this stage the level of risk and payoff are at their greatest. The next round is called Series A. At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or super angel investors. The next rounds are Series B, C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the Initial Public Offering (IPO). Venture capital firms and private equity firms will be participating. Series B: Companies are generating consistent revenue but must scale to meet growing demand. Series C & D: Companies with strong financial performance looking to expand to new markets, develop new products, make an acquisition, and/or preparing for IPO.\n\n\n=== History of startup investing ===\nAfter the Great Depression, which was blamed in part on a rise in speculative investments in unregulated small companies, startup investing was primarily a word of mouth activity reserved for the friends and family of a startup's co-founders, business angels, and Venture Capital funds. In the United States, this has been the case ever since the implementation of the Securities Act of 1933. Many nations implemented similar legislation to prohibit general solicitation and general advertising of unregistered securities, including shares offered by startup companies. In 2005, a new Accelerator investment model was introduced by Y Combinator that combined fixed terms investment model with fixed period intense bootcamp style training program, to streamline the seed/early-stage investment process with training to be more systematic.\nFollowing Y Combinator, many accelerators with similar models have emerged around the world. The accelerator model has since become very common and widely spread and they are key organizations of any Startup ecosystem. Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), first implemented on 23 September 2013, granted startups in and startup co-founders or promoters in US. the right to generally solicit and advertise publicly using any method of communication on the condition that only accredited investors are allowed to purchase the securities. However the regulations affecting equity crowdfunding in different countries vary a lot with different levels and models of freedom and restrictions. In many countries there are no limitations restricting general public from investing to startups, while there can still be other types of restrictions in place, like limiting the amount that companies can seek from investors. Due to positive development and growth of crowdfunding, many countries are actively updating their regulation in regards to crowdfunding.\n\n\n=== Investing online ===\nThe first known investment-based crowdfunding platform for startups was launched in February 2010 by Grow VC, followed by the first US. based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site, but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model for US. markets prior to JOBS Act. With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were taking place in the market. The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time that it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.\n\n\n== Internal startups ==\nInternal startups are a form of corporate entrepreneurship. Large or well-established companies often try to promote innovation by setting up \"internal startups\", new business divisions that operate at arm's length from the rest of the company. Examples include Bell Labs, a research unit within the Bell System and Target Corporation (which began as an internal startup of the Dayton's department store chain) and threedegrees, a product developed by an internal startup of Microsoft.\n\n\n== Unicorns ==\n\nSome startups become big and they become unicorns, i.e. privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. The term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures. As of January 2025, there are 1,523 unicorns worldwide, with a combined valuation of about US$5.6 trillion. The United States leads with 758 unicorns (≈49.8%), followed by China with 343, and India with 64. The unicorns are concentrated in a few countries. The unicorn leaders are the U.S. with 196 companies, China with 165, India with 107 and the U.K. with 16. The largest unicorns included Ant Financial, ByteDance, DiDi, Uber, Xiaomi, and Airbnb. When the value of a company is over US$10 billion, the company will be called as a decacorn. When the company is valued over US$100 billion, hectocorn will be used.\n\n\n== Critiques of the start-up mode ==\nAccording to Nikos Smyrnaios, Silicon Valley's start-ups are emblematic of the post-Fordist enterprise, reflecting a move toward values of liberty, autonomy and authenticity, and away from the Fordist emphasis on solidarity, economic security and equality.\nFor some researchers, such as Antoine Gouritin, the start-up model, like many digital-related objects, is underpinned by a \"solutionist\" logic, as Evgeny Morozov describes it. Technological solutionism corresponds to the belief that thanks to digital tools such as those created by start-ups, simple and technical solutions can be found to all kinds of problems. Therefore, what is expected of start-ups is not that they address the root causes of problems, but that they find effective technical solutions quickly.\nThe organizational model of start-ups is also questioned by former employees. For example, Mathilde Ramadier, a former start-up employee, brings the debate to the fore in France with her book Bienvenue dans le nouveau monde. Comment j'ai survécu à la coolitude des start-ups [Welcome to the new world. How I survived start-up coolness] in 2017. Since then, awareness has been growing. The non-hierarchical organization of start-ups means that all employees bear equal responsibility for their running smoothly. They are based on voluntary commitment and internalized behavioral norms rather than formal hierarchical constraints. Employees, encouraged to meet targets, often exceed overtime limits. Professional and personal life often blend in this highly connected environment. Employees are expected, without discussion, to give of themselves without counting the cost, to be always reachable and available, without asking for compensation commensurate with their professional commitment (in terms of time and activities), and to place the general interest of the organization before their personal interest. Finally, the employment contracts of start-up employees are often precarious since the company itself is not completely stable.\nEconomist Scott A. Shane has used data on start-ups published in many countries to draw conclusions in terms of public policy. He is critical of public policy that encourages start-ups, pointing to evidence that these policies lead people to create marginal businesses that are more likely to fail, have little economic impact, and generate a very limited number of jobs.\n\n\n== Today ==\nToday, the San Francisco bay area has the highest number of startups globally, with 14,500. It is followed by New York City with 12,500 and Silicon Wadi in Israel, with around 9000, which is the highest per capita figure in the world.\nAccording to PitchBook research, nearly 1 in 4 startups claims to be an artificial intelligence company as of 2024.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBrand management\nBusiness incubator\nBusiness plan\nDeep tech\nFlex space\nInnovation\nLiquidity event\nPlatform cooperative\nSmall business\nVesting § Ownership in startup companies\nUnicorn bubble\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "In retail, a product return is the process of a customer taking previously purchased merchandise back to the retailer, and in turn receiving a refund in the original form of payment, exchange.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMany retailers will accept returns provided that the customer has a receipt as a proof of purchase, and that certain other conditions, which depend on the retailer's policies, are met.  These may include the merchandise being in a certain condition (usually resellable if not defective), no more than a certain amount of time having passed since the purchase, and sometimes that identification be provided (though usually only if a receipt is not provided).  In some cases, only exchanges or store credit are offered, again usually only without a receipt, or after an initial refund period has passed. Some retailers charge a restocking fee for non-defective returned merchandise, but typically only if the packaging has been opened.\nIn certain countries, such as Australia, consumer rights dictate that under certain situations consumers have a right to demand a refund. These situations include sales that relied on false or misleading claims, defective goods, and undisclosed conditions of sale.\nThere are various reasons why customers may wish to return merchandise.  These include a change of one's mind (buyer's remorse), quality of the merchandise, personal dissatisfaction, or a mistaken purchase of the wrong product. For clothing or other sized items, it may be a lack of a correct fit.  Sometimes, there may be a product recall in which the manufacturer has requested (or been ordered) that the merchandise be brought back to the store.  Also, gift receipts are offered sometimes when an item is purchased for another person, and the recipient can exchange this item for another item of comparable value, or for store credit, often on a gift card.\n\n\n== Economic impact ==\nIn the US, an estimated 8–10% of in-store sales is returned whereas online sales may result in 25–40% returns.  In Asia and Europe, less than 5 percent of purchases are returned. US shoppers returned $396 billion worth of purchases in 2018 – brick-and-mortar and online, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). To fight high return rates in e-commerce, a realistic product visualization is needed. Next to imagery and video content, 3D technology like augmented reality and virtual reality, but also simply 3D in the browser can enhance the shopping experience and lower return rates.\nIn the UK, Logistics costs for returns is estimated at between £20bn and £60bn per year. Figures show that 33% of retailers had to increase prices to counter rising returns volumes whilst 31% of retailers said managing returns impacts their profits. For some companies the costs of accepting returns amounts to as much as 5% of their annual turnover.\n\n\n== Issues ==\n\n\n=== Fraudulent returns ===\n\nIn the United States, various abuses using the return process allegedly cost retailers more than $9 billion annually.\nOne common practice is the use of the system in order to \"borrow\" the merchandise at no charge. The customer who engages in this practice purchases the item for temporary use, then returns it when finished. Examples include an article of clothing worn for a single occasion, or a book that is returned after it has been read. This practice is called \"wardrobing.\"  Stores such as Macy's and Ross put large \"do not remove\" tags on women's dresses to try to defeat this, not accepting returns or exchanges for any items that do not have the tag.  Many stores also refuse to refund certain items like reading materials, inflatable airbeds (Target and Walmart), and even portable heaters (Dollar General).\nAnother problem is when customers legitimately purchase an item, then re-enter the store with the receipt, take an identical item off the shelf, and approach the customer service desk requesting a refund.  In the process, they essentially receive the item for free, and may be charged with shoplifting or another similar crime if caught.\nOthers have been reported to print fake receipts which they use to return stolen merchandise for a cash refund.  However, this is nearly impossible now that most stores use individually numbered receipts.  Scanning the receipt's barcode at the cash register links legitimate returns to a database that validates the original purchase. (Despite this, some stores that have had such systems for years still refuse to accept a photocopy of a legitimate receipt where the original may have been misplaced, or obscured due to the store's use of cheap thermal paper or very light ink.)\n\n\n=== Denying returns ===\nSome retailers have turned to a practice in which customers who return or exchange items excessively (beyond the guidelines set by a retailer) may be prevented from making a return or exchange with that particular company.\nIn the United States, a company called The Retail Equation (formerly The Return Exchange) collects data from participating retailers via a swipe of a driver's license, or most other types of government issued photo identification. The information found on the license is collected into a database, and other stores operated by that particular retail company can use this information to deny a return. This system can be used to prevent various problems, such as return fraud. These controversial practices of collecting information have been addressed by privacy rights advocates and spurred a movement for boycotting chains that collect consumers' private information and allow third party sources to use it.\nThe request of presenting a form of identification for returning products and collecting the information has stirred controversy, especially if the customer that purchased the product was a minor (under the age of 18).\nImmigrant rights groups have voiced serious concern over the practice since most illegal immigrants don't have a state ID or a drivers license and this practice could potentially be used to discriminate against them, however, all of the stores that are associated with The Retail Equation, accepts all types of government issued photo identification, including, but not limited to, driver's licences (regardless of issuing state), state identification card (regardless of issuing state), passports (regardless of issuing country), Mexican matricula consular documents, concealed carry firearm permits (regardless of issuing state), and uniformed services identification cards. \n\n\n=== Legislation ===\nLegislation exists in various parts of the world giving consumers the right to return goods in as-supplied condition for a full refund, within a set period of time, known as a cooling-off period. Sometimes this legislation only applies to distance sales such as e-commerce.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCooling-off period (consumer rights)\nLemon law\nMoney back guarantee\nPackage redirection scam\nReturn merchandise authorization\nReverse logistics\nWarranty\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Retail Equation homepage, describes details about the agency and returning",

        "content": "Professional liability insurance (PLI), also called professional indemnity insurance (PII) and commonly known as errors & omissions (E&O) in the US, is a form of liability insurance which helps protect professional advising, consulting, and service-providing individuals and companies from bearing the full cost of defending against a negligence claim made by a client     in a civil lawsuit. The coverage focuses on alleged failure to perform on the part of, financial loss caused by, and error or omission in the service or product sold by the policyholder. These are causes for legal action that would not be covered by a more general liability insurance policy which addresses more direct forms of harm. Professional liability insurance may take on different forms and names depending on the profession, especially medical and legal, and is sometimes required under contract by other businesses that are the beneficiaries of the advice or service.\nCoverage almost always provides for the defense costs, including when legal action turns out to be groundless. Coverage does not include criminal prosecution, nor a wide range of potential liabilities under civil law that are not enumerated in the policy, but which may be subject to other forms of insurance. Professional liability insurance is required by law in some areas for certain kinds of professional practice.\n\n\n== Rationale ==\nThe primary reason for professional liability coverage is that a typical general liability insurance policy will respond only to a bodily injury, property damage, personal injury or advertising injury claim. Other forms of insurance cover employers, public and product liability. However, various professional services and products can give rise to legal claims without causing any of the specific types of harm covered by such policies. Common claims that professional liability insurance covers are negligence, misrepresentation, violation of good faith, and inaccurate advice. Examples:\n\nIf a software product fails to perform properly or as-intended, it may not cause physical, personal, or advertising damages. Therefore, the general liability policy would not be triggered; it may, however, directly cause financial losses which could potentially be attributed to the software developer's misrepresentation of the product capabilities.\nIf a custom-designed product fails without causing damage to person or property other than to the subject product itself, a product liability policy may cover consequential damages such as losses from business interruption, but will generally not cover the cost to redesign, repair or replace the failed product itself.  Claims for these losses against the manufacturer may be covered by a professional liability policy.\n\n\n== Coverage ==\nProfessional liability insurance policies are generally set up based on a claims-made and reported basis, meaning that the policy covers only those claims made and reported to their carrier during the policy period. More specifically a typical policy will provide indemnity to the insured against loss arising from any claim or claims made during the policy period by reason of any covered error, omission or negligent act committed in the conduct of the insured's professional business during the policy period. Claims which may relate to incidents occurring before the coverage was active may not be covered, although some policies may have a retroactive date, such that claims made during the policy period but which relate to an incident after the retroactive date (where the retroactive date is earlier than the inception date of the policy) are covered. Retroactive cover is usually offered as an additional option to include cover within a policy for work one has already done or services one has already provided.\nCoverage does not include criminal prosecution, nor all forms of legal liability under civil law, only those specifically enumerated in the policy. Unlike general liability coverage, professional liability coverage extends coverage for acts that are intentional, so long as the damages caused were not intentional.\nSome policies are more tightly worded than others. While a number of policy wordings are designed to satisfy a stated minimum approved wording, which makes them easier to compare, others differ dramatically in the coverage they provide. For example, a breach of duty may be included if the incident occurred and was reported by the policyholder to the insurer during the policy period.  Wordings with major legal differences can be confusingly similar to non-lawyers. Coverage for \"negligent act, error or omission\" indemnifies the policyholder against loss/circumstances incurred only as a result of any professional error or omission, or negligent act (i.e., the modifier \"negligent\" does not apply to all three categories, though any non-legal reader might assume that it did). A \"negligent act, negligent error or negligent omission\" clause is a much more restrictive policy and would deny coverage in a lawsuit alleging a non-negligent error or omission.\nCoverage is usually continued for as long as the policyholder provides covered services or products, plus the span of any applicable statute of limitations. Canceling the policy before this time would in effect make it as if the insured never had coverage for any incidents since any client could bring any case with regard to any such services or products that occurred before the statute of limitations cut-off point. A break in coverage could result in what is called a \"gap in coverage\", which is the loss of all prior acts.\n\n\n== Differences across professions ==\n\n\n=== Medical profession ===\nThe negligent act is called medical malpractice and the insuring contract is called malpractice insurance.\n\n\n=== Legal profession ===\nThe negligent act is called legal malpractice and the insuring contract is called lawyers professional liability insurance. or LPL\nMalpractice coverage is very important to attorneys because a bad case can produce a lot of bad publicity that can significantly harm a law firm's reputation. Nearly all LPL policies are claims made. Most policies will require the attorney or Insured to report any claim, alleged error, or facts that could give rise to a malpractice complaint as soon as they learn of the mistake. An Insured's coverage only goes back as far as the prior acts retroactive date. If the attorney has had constant LPL coverage from day one, it is considered \"Full Prior Acts\". LPL are most often written in one year \"policy period\". Each policy period is its own contract so the coverages may change slightly from year to year. If an insurance company makes any significant changes, they're typically required to send a \"fire watch\" letter to their policyholders to explain the change. Insurance companies are either admitted or non-admitted to each state.\nThere are five important factors to consider when purchasing LPL coverage: 1) Premium, 2) Policy Limits and Deductible, 3) Coverages and Exclusions, 4) Defense Expenses, and 5) Company Organization.\n\nPremium\nWhile the cost of the policy is obviously the primary factor for many law firms, careful examination is necessary to ensure that a lower premium does not correlate to less coverage. Insurance companies hire underwriters to evaluate each firm's risk based on the number of attorneys, number of staff, areas of practice, geographic regions, gross billed work, claim history, and other factors. Premiums may vary depending on the underwriter's risk appetite.\n\nPolicy Limits and Deductible\nThe policy limit is how much the insurance company will spend to defend covered claims. Limits are written with the per occurrence limit first and then the aggregate limit per policy period. The per policy limit is how much the company will spend on each claim and the aggregate is the limit of how much will be spent per policy period across several claims. The limits are set and do not renew every policy period.\n\nCoverages and Exclusion\nA typical coverage is for \"Professional Services\" \"On behalf of Another\". Professional Services means the work done as an attorney, which means that driving accidents on the way to a deposition or broken desk lamps are not covered. On behalf of another means the professional service is benefiting an outside party, which means that internal law firm employment issues or defending one's own DUI are not covered. Nearly all LPL policies exclude coverage for return of professional fees, which is when the client is asking for some or all of their money back. Meritless claims still need to be reported for coverage. Many attorneys believe that vexatious litigants will go away on their own but those claims can stretch out for years. \n\nDefense Expenses\nFirst Dollar Defense and Defense Outside the Limits are two primary features of an LPL policy that should be looked at carefully.  First Dollar Defense means that the insurance company will not apply the deductible to the defense costs.  This allows the company to promptly investigate and address solvable issues.  The Defense Outside the Limits refers to whether the defense costs come out of the limits or not.\n\nCompany Organization\nMost of the large insurance companies have an LPL policy but there are also several mutual companies.  A mutual insurance company is owned by its policyholders.  The company will take in premiums, pay settlements and verdicts, pay their operating costs, and then return the remainder in the form of a dividend.  Many state bar associations have formed their own LPL Mutual insurance company.\n\n\n=== Insurance agents, consultants, and brokers ===\nuse the term errors and omissions (E&O) insurance  Other professions that commonly purchase professional liability insurance include accounting, engineering, land surveying and financial services, construction and maintenance (general contractors, plumbers, etc., many of whom are also surety bonded), and transport. Some charities and other nonprofits/NGOs are also professional-liability insured.\nThis type of insurance is in fact pretty common all over the world, being considered the main risk management instrument both for individuals and companies. The regulation in force, though, may vary and there can be significant differences between a country and another; in the European Union, despite the efforts at harmonizing the rules involved in this segment of the market, every country has its own framework legislation, resulting in a wide range of options. In the recent past countries like Italy adopted a number of dispositions that introduced an obligation for every category of self employed professionals to acquire this form of insurance; such obligation has become effective only with the definition of all the parameters.\nFinaccord, one of the leading international market research and consulting companies, has estimated that in the first 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) the total value of this branch will rise from 6.15 billion US dollars in 2009 to 7.5 billion dollars by the end of 2017.\n\n\n== Errors and omissions insurance ==\nErrors and omissions (E&O) insurance, which may exclude negligent acts other than errors and omissions (\"mistakes\"), is most often used by consultants and brokers and agents of various sorts, including notaries public, real estate brokers, insurance agents themselves, appraisers, management consultants and information technology service providers (there are specific E&O policies for software developers, home inspectors, website developers, etc.), architects, landscape architects, engineers, land surveyors, attorneys, third-party business administrators, quality control specialists, nondestructive testing analysts, and many others. A mistake which causes financial harm to another can occur in almost any transaction in many professions.\n\n\n=== Gaps in coverage ===\nA gap in coverage, or lapse in coverage could result from not renewing the E&O coverage the same day it expires. Several carriers who underwrite policies will not allow professionals to backdate their coverage to their  expiration date without a valid explanation (such as, but not limited to: natural disaster or personal medical issue that prevented one from renewing on time) and a signed warranty letter informing the carrier the specific professional is not aware of any pending claims. For example, with an effective date of 06/01/2010 and coverage expiring on 06/01/2011 and the insured does not renew the coverage on or before 06/01/2011 then the insured may have to enroll with a gap in coverage, resulting in a loss of prior acts coverage such that there is no coverage for any business placed prior to their new effective date. Although some carriers may allow a 30- to 45-day grace period, it is common for them to disallow this.\nGaps in coverage are common in E&O coverage. A modest survey suggested most professionals are unaware what a gap in coverage is or its harsh consequences. Several professionals incorrectly believed they did not need continuous coverage if they were not writing business during specific months.\nA gap in coverage should not be confused with terminating or not renewing a policy due to retirement or death. In these cases, an extended reporting policy (ERP), may be purchased. \n\n\n== Extended reporting policy (tail) coverage ==\n\"Tail\" or \"extended reporting\" endorsements, known as run-off insurance or run-off cover in the UK, cover events that occur while the policy is in force but are reported to the carrier after the policy terminates. The availability of extended reporting policies depends on the carrier, the specific policy, and the reason for terminating business. Certain provisions will limit the professional from writing new business during the ERP, since only past policies are generally covered in an ERP or run-off policy, nothing current or new. Many claims-made policies contain provisions to offer an extended reporting period if the policy is non-renewed. The typical tail extends the reporting period only for claims up to six months or one year after the policy expiration date. An additional premium is charged when the extended reporting option is exercised.\n\"Prior acts\" (or \"nose\") coverage transfers the retro-active date for an old policy to a new insurance carrier—eliminating the need to purchase tail coverage from the last carrier. Nose coverage is usually less expensive than purchasing tail coverage from the old carrier. Tail coverage costs 2–3 times the expiring premium.\n\n\n== Civil liability insurance ==\nSome policies go further than the standard coverage. Professional liability insurance coverage usually does not include defamation (libel and slander), breach of contract, breach of warranty, intellectual property, personal injury, security, and cost of contract. Coverage can often be added to provide indemnity \"for any civil liability\".\nBecause the operative clause of a civil liability policy is so wide, there is normally a long list of exclusions so that liabilities, like employers liability and public liability, that are the subject of other forms of insurance are not covered by the policy.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "Lily was a California-based drone brand that shut down after filing for bankruptcy in 2017. It is owned by Mota Group, Inc. and headquartered in San Jose, California.\n\n\n== History ==\nLily Robotics was founded in 2013 in Berkeley, California by UC Berkeley alums Antoine Balaresque and Henry Bradlow, with the goal of designing and manufacturing a quadcopter camera drone. Both founders worked together at the UC Berkeley Robotics Laboratory.\nThe idea for Lily's first product, the Lily Camera, came in the summer of 2013 after Balaresque returned from a family trip to Yosemite National Park and noticed that his mother was missing from all of the photos because she was behind the camera.\nThe founders secured a seed round in spring 2014 led by Shana Fisher and SV Angel, and in 2015 the company expanded to employ approximately 50 individuals.\nIn May 2015, the company announced the Lily Camera, an autonomous flying camera that combined GPS and computer vision technology to record stills and video of users autonomously via a wearable tracking device. The company received approximately 60 thousand pre-orders for the device, collecting over $34 million in pre-sale revenue. International Business Times compared the new startup to the Zano, a similar camera-drone project which was still in development at the time, but later failed and closed down.\nIn December 2015, Lily reportedly closed a Series A funding round of $14 million, led by Spark Capital. Other notable Lily investors were the Stanford StartX fund, the DJ Steve Aoki and the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. The founders announced that the original February 2016 release date for pre-order customers would be delayed until summer 2016.\n\n\n== Closure, lawsuit, bankruptcy, and asset-acquisition ==\nOn January 12, 2017, around 4AM UTC, Lily sent an email to all their customers notifying them that the camera could not be produced and they would receive a refund. The company closed owing $34 million.\nOn the same day, the District Attorney of San Francisco filed a lawsuit against Lily alleging that the startup intentionally deceived customers. According to the lawsuit, Lily faked demonstration videos using products from other manufacturers. In late January 2017, the San Francisco police, seeking evidence for criminal charges related to the company's failure, conducted a raid of the Lily Robotics offices.\nOn February 27, 2017, Lily Robotics filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The company also issued a notice to customers stating: \"We will try to refund all of our customers' pre-order payments during the bankruptcy. However, we need Bankruptcy Court approval of a refund process to make those payments. To begin the process, the Company filed a motion on March 13, 2017 asking the Bankruptcy Court to approve the refund process.\"\nOn May 30, 2017, Mota Group Inc. acquired assets of Lily and its brand. The company, already managing other brands and drone lines, introduced Lily Next-Gen™ with superior 2017 technology based on the original Lily approach of simplicity and market.\n\n\n== The Lily Camera ==\nLily's original flagship product, the Lily Camera, was a quadcopter drone designed to be used as a self-propelled camera. The device has a waterproof rating of IP67. It is built out of black polycarbonate and brushed aluminum, and weighs approximately 2.8 pounds (1.3 kg). The Lily Camera contains 7 types of sensors: an accelerometer, a three-axis gyroscope, a magnetometer, a Barometer, GPS, a front-facing camera, and a bottom-facing camera. The camera captures video with 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, and 720p at 120 frames per second.\nLike the Lily Camera, the wearable tracker has a waterproof rating of IP67. The tracker contains 5 sensors: an accelerometer, a barometer, GPS, a microphone, and a small vibration motor.\nLily Next-Gen™ included the same type of form factor but with 4K camera, a standalone remote and up to 36 minutes of flying time with combined battery.\n\n\n== See also ==\nZano (drone) - a similar project to create a quadcopter drone with a camera, which failed under similar circumstances\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A tax refund is a payment to the taxpayer due because the taxpayer has paid more taxes than owed.\n\n\n== United States ==\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service, 77% of tax returns filed in 2004 resulted in a refund check, with the average refund check being $2,100. In 2011, the average tax refund was $2,913. For the 2017 tax year the average refund was $2,035 and for 2018 it was 8% less at $1,865, reflecting the changes brought by the most sweeping changes to the tax code in 30 years. \nThe latest data from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  agency shows that the total amount refunded to taxpayers by IRS through 2023 will be approximately $198.9 billion, which is $23.5 billion less than in 2022. That equates to an average refund of $2,878 — or $297 less per person than last tax season.\nTaxpayers may choose to have their refund directly deposited into their bank account, have a check mailed to them, or have their refund applied to the following year's income tax. As of 2006, tax filers may split their tax refund with direct deposit in up to three separate accounts with three different financial institutions. This has given taxpayers an opportunity to save and spend some of their refund (rather than only spend their refund). Every year, a number of U.S. taxpayers around the country get tax refunds even if they owe zero income tax. This is due to withholding calculations and the earned income tax credit. Because withholding is calculated on an annualized basis, an individual just entering the work force or unemployed for a long period of time will have more tax than is owed withheld. Refund anticipation loans are a common means to receive a tax refund early, but at the expense of high fees that can reach over 200% annual interest. In the 1990s, refunds could take as long as twelve weeks to come back to the taxpayer; the  average time for a refund is six weeks, with refunds from electronically filed returns coming in three weeks.\nSome people believe that getting a large tax refund is not as desirable as more accurate withholding throughout the year, as a large refund represents a loan paid back by the government interest-free. Optimally, a return should result in a payment owed of just less than the amount that would cause a penalty charge, which is 100% of the prior year's tax (110% for high income individuals), 90% of the current year's tax, or $1,000 for individuals who have direct withholding and do not pay estimated tax. In order to decrease the amount of the tax refund which has to be received by taxpayers, they can turn to one or several of the following methods:\n\nadjust the amount of tax the federal government withholds from the paycheck. It is recommended for taxpayers to do this in cases where their adjustments to income, exemptions, and deductions remain relatively steady from year-to-year, and if the government consistently is required to give a large refund.\nin the case of people entirely exempt from state tax, they can check with their state income tax authority to see if there is an appropriate form that can be completed and filed, which would exempt them from state withholding\ncheck tax rates and adjusted gross income thresholds (applicable if taxpayers are hovering near the bottom of certain tax brackets and changes have been made to the thresholds and/or tax rates)\ntake advantage of the medical expense deduction (applicable for medical expenses now imposed for tax years starting in 2013)\nmaximizing the amount allowed to save tax-free for retirement\nHowever, some people use the tax refund as a simple \"savings plan\" to get money back each year (even though it is excess money that they paid earlier in the year). Another argument is that it is better to get a refund rather than to owe money, because in the latter case one might find oneself without sufficient funds to make the necessary payment. When properly filled out, the Form W-4 will withhold approximately the correct amount of tax to eliminate a refund or amount owed, assuming the W-4 was filled out at the beginning of the tax year.\nA U.S. federal law signed in 1996 contained a provision that required the federal government to make electronic payments by 1999. In 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department paired with Comerica Bank to offer the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The card is used to make payments to federal benefit recipients who do not have a bank account. Tax refunds are exempt from the electronic payments requirement. Many U.S. states send tax refunds in the form of prepaid debit cards to people who do not have bank accounts.\n\n\n== New Zealand ==\nIn New Zealand, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. This information is collected and held by the Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand) (IRD) and is not automatically processed. However individual earners can request a summary of earnings to see if they have overpaid or underpaid their tax for each given financial year. To claim a tax refund, a personal tax summary must be filed; this can be done by dealing with the IRD directly or through a Tax Agent. If a personal tax summary is requested in a situation where tax would be owing, a debt is created, so correct calculations prior to this request are important, and these core services are offered by third party Tax Agents. Tax Agents in New Zealand are largely self-regulating, with the Online Tax Association of New Zealand (OTANZ) providing guidance and governing rules for New Zealand's largest four tax refund agencies who serve most of the market for personal tax refunds.\n\n\n== India ==\nIn India, there is a provision of refund of excess tax along with interest. For claiming a refund one has to file the income tax return within a specified period. However, under Sections 237 and 119(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act, the Chief Commissioner or Commissioner of Income Tax are empowered to condone a delay in the claim of a refund.\nProvisions of refund of duty exists in indirect taxation. In Section 11 B of the Central Excises Act 1944 which is also applicable in the cases of Service Tax as defined in the Finance Act 1994.\n\n\n== United Kingdom ==\nIn the United Kingdom, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system via HMRC. Some refunds such as those due to changing tax codes or similar circumstances will be automatically processed via a P800 form. A change of circumstances, such as a change of employment or second job, sometimes results in overpaid tax which can be claimed back. It is also possible to make more complex claims under both PAYE and self-employment circumstances, for example if employed by the Ministry of Defence or Construction Industry Scheme used by construction trade subcontractors. In such cases tax refunds for various work related expenses can also be claimed for up to the last four tax years; common examples include costs for accommodation (for example for offshore workers staying overnight before transport to a rig), food purchased while travelling between workplaces, or the purchase or hire or specialist equipment.\n\n\n== Ireland ==\nIn the Republic of Ireland, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE (Pay As You Earn) tax system. If incorrect tax credits are applied by the employer, then a refund of tax is due. Tax refunds may also be due for income deductions that are applied after the tax year has ended, if one finishes working prior to the year end, or for joint assessment of taxes for a married couple. Tax refunds must be claimed within four years of the end of the tax year if the one is assessed under the PAYE tax system.\n\n\n== Canada ==\nIn Canada, income tax is deducted by the employer under the PAYE tax system. Taxes must be paid in a series of quarterly installments during the year that the income is earned. A significant decrease in income for self-employed individuals or a forgotten deduction on the TD1 form can result in an overpayment of taxes. Those who file their taxes online by the deadline of April 30 should receive their refund within two weeks, while those who file by paper can expect a longer turnaround period of eight weeks. The Canada Revenue Agency will pay compounded daily interest on delayed refunds, beginning on the later of May 31 or 31 days after the return is filed. Refunds are paid by cheque or direct deposit, with the direct deposit being the quicker option of the two. In some cases the CRA may keep some or all of a refund. These cases include owed tax balances, Garnishment, and the existence of outstanding government debt.\n\n\n== References ==",

SLAs may be supported by operational-level agreements, or OLAs.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince the late 1980s SLAs have been used by fixed-line telecom operators. SLAs are so widely used these days that larger organizations have many different SLAs existing within the company itself, such that two different units in an organization script an SLA with one unit being the customer and another being the service provider. This practice helps to maintain the same quality of service amongst different units in the organization and also across multiple locations of the organization. This internal scripting of SLA also helps to compare the quality of service between an in-house department and an external service provider.\nThe output received by the customer as a result of the service provided is the main focus of the service level agreement.\nService level agreements are also defined at different levels:\n\nCustomer-based SLA: An agreement with an individual customer group, covering all the services they use.\nService-based SLA: An agreement for all customers using the services being delivered by the service provider.\nMultilevel SLA: The SLA is split into the different levels, each addressing different set of customers for the same services, in the same SLA.\nCorporate-level SLA: Covering all the generic service level management issues appropriate to every customer throughout the organization.\nCustomer-level SLA: covering all SLM issues relevant to the particular customer group, regardless of the services being used.\nService-level SLA: covering all SLM issue relevant to the specific services, in relation to this specific customer group.\n\n\n== Best practices ==\nAccording to Dinesh Verma, a well-defined and typical SLA will contain the following components:\n\nType of service to be provided\nIt specifies the type of service and any additional details of the type of service to be provided. In the case of an IP network connectivity, the type of service will describe functions such as operation and maintenance of networking equipment, connection bandwidth to be provided, etc.\nThe service's desired performance level, especially its reliability and responsiveness\nA reliable service will be the one that suffers minimum disruption in a specific amount of time and is available at almost all times. Service with good responsiveness will perform the desired action promptly after the customer requests it.\nMonitoring process and service level reporting\nThis component describes how the performance levels are supervised and monitored. This process involves gathering different types of statistics, how frequently these statistics will be collected and how they will be accessed by the customers.\nThe steps for reporting issues with the service\nThis component will specify the contact details to report the problem and the order in which details about the issue have to be reported. The contract will also include a time range in which the problem will be looked into and when the issue will be resolved.\nResponse and issue resolution time frame\nThe response time frame is the period by which the service provider will start the investigation of the issue. Issue resolution time frame is the period by which the current service issue will be resolved and fixed.\nRepercussions for the service provider not meeting its commitment\nIf the provider is not able to meet the requirements as stated in SLA then the service provider will have to face consequences. These consequences may include the customer's right to terminate the contract or ask for a refund for losses incurred by the customer due to failure of service.\n\n\n== Specific examples ==\n\n\n=== Backbone Internet providers ===\nIt is not uncommon for an internet backbone service provider (or network service provider) to explicitly state its SLA on its website. The U.S. Telecommunications Act of 1996 does not expressly mandate that companies have SLAs, but it does provide a framework for firms to do so in Sections 251 and 252. Section 252(c)(1) for example (\"Duty to Negotiate\") requires incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to negotiate in good faith about matters such as resale and access to rights of way.\nNew emerging technologies such as 5G bring new complexities to the network operators. With more stringent SLAs and customer expectations, problem resolutions must be prioritized based on impacted subscribers.\n\n\n=== Fixed networks ===\nFor fixed networks subscribers, service modeling appears to be one of the most suitable ways to effectively monitor SLA's and ensure they are met.\n\n\n=== WSLA ===\nA web service level agreement (WSLA) is a standard for service level agreement compliance monitoring of web services. It allows authors to specify the performance metrics associated with a web service application, desired performance targets, and actions that should be performed when performance is not met.\nWSLA Language Specification, version 1.0 was published by IBM in 2001.\n\n\n=== Cloud computing ===\nThe underlying benefit of cloud computing is shared resources, which are supported by the underlying nature of a shared infrastructure environment. Thus, SLAs span across the cloud and are offered by service providers as a service-based agreements rather than a customer-based agreements. Measuring, monitoring and reporting on cloud performance is based on the end UX or their ability to consume resources. The downside of cloud computing relative to SLAs is the difficulty in determining the root cause of service interruptions due to the complex nature of the environment.\nAs applications are moved from dedicated hardware into the cloud, they need to achieve the same even more demanding levels of service than classical installations. SLAs for cloud services focus on characteristics of the data center and more recently include characteristics of the network (see carrier cloud) to support end-to-end SLAs.\nAny SLA management strategy considers two well-differentiated phases: negotiating the contract and monitoring its fulfillment in real-time. Thus, SLA management encompasses the SLA contract definition: the basic schema with the QoS parameters; SLA negotiation; SLA monitoring; SLA violation detection; and SLA enforcement—according to defined policies.\nThe main point is to build a new layer upon the grid, cloud, or SOA middleware able to create a negotiation mechanism between the providers and consumers of services. An example is the EU–funded Framework 7 research project, SLA@SOI, which is researching aspects of multi-level, multi-provider SLAs within service-oriented infrastructure and cloud computing, while another EU-funded project, VISION Cloud, has provided results concerning content-oriented SLAs.\nFP7 IRMOS also investigated aspects of translating application-level SLA terms to resource-based attributes to bridge the gap between client-side expectations and cloud-provider resource-management mechanisms. A summary of the results of various research projects in the area of SLAs (ranging from specifications to monitoring, management and enforcement) has been provided by the European Commission.\n\n\n=== Outsourcing ===\nOutsourcing involves the transfer of responsibility from an organization to a supplier. This new arrangement is managed through a contract that may include one or more SLAs. The contract may involve financial penalties and the right to terminate if any of the SLA metrics are consistently missed. The setting, tracking and managing SLAs is an important part of the outsourcing relationship management (ORM) discipline. Specific SLAs are typically negotiated upfront as part of the outsourcing contract and used as one of the primary tools of outsourcing governance.\nIn software development, specific SLAs can apply to application outsourcing contracts in line with standards in software quality, as well as recommendations provided by neutral organizations like CISQ, which has published numerous papers on the topic (such as Using Software Measurement in SLAs) that are available in to the public.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBest-effort delivery\nIT cost transparency\nNetwork monitoring\nService level\nService-oriented architecture (SOA)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nService Level Agreement (SLA) S-Cube Knowledge Model",

        "content": "Service level measures the performance of a system, service or supply. Certain goals are defined and the service level gives the percentage to which those goals should be achieved.\nExamples of service level:\n\nPercentage of calls answered in a call center\nPercentage of customers waiting less than a given fixed time\nPercentage of customers that do not experience a stockout\nPercentage of all parts of an order being fulfilled completely\nUse of a safety stock to ensure that a target percentage of orders can be met in full and on time.\nThe term \"service level\" is used in supply-chain management and in inventory management to measure the performance of inventory replenishment policies. Under consideration, from the optimal solution of such a model also the optimal size of back orders can be derived.  A back order is an order placed for an item which is out-of-stock and awaiting fulfillment. Unfortunately, this optimization approach requires that the planner knows the optimal value of the back order costs. As these costs are difficult to quantify in practice, the logistical performance of an inventory node in a supply network is measured with the help of technical performance measures. The target values of these measures are set by the decision maker.\n\n\n== Definitions and typology ==\nSeveral definitions of service levels are used in the literature as well as in practice. These may differ not only with respect to their scope and to the number of considered products but also with respect to the time interval they are related to. These performance measures are the key performance indicators (KPI) of an inventory node which must be regularly monitored. If the controlling of the performance of an inventory node is neglected, the decision maker will not be able to optimize the processes within a supply chain.\n\n\n=== α service level (type 1) ===\nThe α service level is an event-oriented performance criterion. It measures the probability that all customer orders arriving within a given time interval will be completely delivered from stock on hand, i.e. without delay.\nTwo versions are discussed in the literature differing with respect to the time interval within which the customers arrive. With reference to a demand period, α denotes the probability that an arbitrarily arriving customer order will be completely served from stock on hand, i.e. without an inventory-related waiting time (period \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{p}}\n  \n service level):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n        =\n        P\n        r\n        o\n        b\n        {\n        P\n        e\n        r\n        i\n        o\n        d\n         \n        d\n        e\n        m\n        a\n        n\n        d\n        ≤\n        \n        \n          I\n          n\n          v\n          e\n          n\n          t\n          o\n          r\n          y\n           \n          o\n          n\n           \n          h\n          a\n          n\n          d\n           \n          a\n          t\n           \n          t\n          h\n          e\n           \n          b\n          e\n          g\n          i\n          n\n          n\n          i\n          n\n          g\n           \n          o\n          f\n           \n          a\n           \n          p\n          e\n          r\n          i\n          o\n          d\n        \n        }\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{p}=Prob\\{Period~demand\\leq \\;{Inventory~on~hand~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}\\}}\n  \n.\nIn order to determine the safety stock that guarantees a target \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          α\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\alpha _{p}}\n  \n service level, the stationary probability distribution of the inventory on hand must be known.

That is, the probability of demand during that leadtime being less than or equal to the amount of stock you had left when you ordered. It assumes your reorder point is positive, that orders are in unit increments and inventory is monitored continuously so you cannot stock out prior to reordering.\n\n\n=== β service level (type 2) ===\nThe β service level is a quantity-oriented performance measure describing the proportion of total demand within a reference period which is delivered without delay from stock on hand:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        β\n        =\n        1\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              E\n              x\n              p\n              e\n              c\n              t\n              e\n              d\n               \n              b\n              a\n              c\n              k\n              o\n              r\n              d\n              e\n              r\n              s\n               \n              p\n              e\n              r\n               \n              t\n              i\n              m\n              e\n               \n              p\n              e\n              r\n              i\n              o\n              d\n            \n            \n              E\n              x\n              p\n              e\n              c\n              t\n              e\n              d\n               \n              p\n              e\n              r\n              i\n              o\n              d\n               \n              d\n              e\n              m\n              a\n              n\n              d\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta =1-{\\frac {Expected~backorders~per~time~period}{Expected~period~demand}}}\n  \n\nThis is equal to the probability that an arbitrary demand unit is delivered without delay.

One example of a service rate measures the number of units filled as a percentage of the total ordered and is known as fill rate. Fill rate is different from service level. If a customer orders 1000 units, and their supplier can only provide 900 units of that order, their fill rate is 90%.\nIn statistics, notably in queuing theory, service rate denotes the rate at which customers are being served in a system. It is the reciprocal of the service time. For example, a supermarket cash desk with an average service time of 30 seconds per customer would have an average service rate of 2 per minute. In statistics the Greek letter \n  \n    \n      \n        μ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu }\n  \n is used for the service rate.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term \"Service Level Agreement\" (SLA) is frequently used for all aspects of a service level, but in more precise use one may distinguish:\n\nService Level Indicator (SLI): measures of service level, like availability (uptime);\nService Level Objective (SLO): objectives based on these indicators, like 99.95% availability;\nService Level Agreement (SLA): contract based on these objectives; a sample clause may be \"if availability is 99% to 99.95% in a given month, the customer gets 10% off their monthly bill\".\nSLIs form the basis of SLOs, which in turn form the basis of SLAs. If an SLO is missed, customers will typically receive a credit or rebate, as stipulated by the SLA. A missed SLO is sometimes casually referred to as an SLA violation, but this is actually within the scope of the SLA; if an SLA itself is violated (e.g., by not giving a rebate for a missed SLO), it is instead likely to result in a court case for breach of contract.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInventory\nInventory optimization\nService level agreement (SLA)\nService level indicator (SLI)\nService level objective (SLO)\nService level requirement (SLR)\nStockout\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTempelmeier, Horst, Inventory Management in Supply Networks, Norderstedt (Books on Demand) 2006, ISBN 3-8334-5373-7\nHow to calculate Fill Rate and On-time In-full Inventory Metrics",

        "content": "A service-level objective (SLO), as per the O'Reilly Site Reliability Engineering book, is a \"target value or range of values for a service level that is measured by an SLI.\" An SLO is a key element of a service-level agreement (SLA) between a service provider and a customer.  SLOs are agreed upon as a means of measuring the performance of the service provider and are outlined as a way of avoiding disputes between the two parties based on misunderstanding.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThere is often confusion in the use of SLAs and SLOs. The SLA is the entire agreement that specifies what service is to be provided, how it is supported, times, locations, costs, performance, and responsibilities of the parties involved. SLOs are specific measurable characteristics of the SLA such as availability, throughput, frequency, response time, or quality. These SLOs together are meant to define the expected service between the provider and the customer and vary depending on the service's urgency, resources, and budget. SLOs provide a quantitative means to define the level of service a customer can expect from a provider.\nThe SLO are formed by setting goals for metrics (commonly called service level indicators, SLIs). As an example, an availability SLO may be defined as the expected measured value of an availability SLI over a prescribed duration (e.g. four weeks). The availability SLI used will vary based on the nature and architecture of the service.  For example, a simple web service might use the ratio of successful responses served vs the total number of valid requests received. (total_success / total_valid) \n\n\n== Examples ==\nSturm and Morris argue  that SLOs must be:\n\nAttainable\nRepeatable\nMeasurable\nUnderstandable\nMeaningful\nControllable\nAffordable\nMutually acceptable\nWhile Andrieux et al. define the SLO as \"the quality of service aspect of the agreement. Syntactically, it is an assertion over the terms of the agreement as well as such qualities as date and time\". Keller and Ludwig more concisely define an SLO as \"commitment to maintain a particular state of the service in a given period\" with respect to the state of the SLA parameters.  Keller and Ludwig go on to state that while service providers will most often be the lead entity in taking on SLOs there is no firm definition as such and any entity can be responsible for an SLO.  Along with this an SLO can be broken down into a number of different components.\n\nObliged - The entity that is required to deliver the SLO.\nValidity Period - The time in which the SLO will be delivered.\nExpression - This is the actual language that defines what the SLO will be.\nOptionally an EvaluationEvent maybe assigned to the SLO, an EvaluationEvent is defined as the measure by which the SLO will be checked to see if it's meeting the Expression.\nSLOs should generally be specified in terms of an achievement value or service level, a target measurement, a measurement period, and where and how they are measured. As an example, \"90% of calls to the helpdesk should be answered in less than 20 seconds measured over a one-month period as reported by the ACD system\". Results can be reported as a percent of time that the target answer time was achieved and then compared to the desired service level (90%).\n\n\n== Term usage ==\nThe SLO term is found in various scientific papers,  for instance in the reference architecture of the SLA@SOI project, and it is used in the Open Grid Forum document on WS-Agreement.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nService Level Objectives\nWhat are SLOs?

        "content": "Troubleshooting is a form of problem solving, often applied to repair failed products or processes on a machine or a system.  It is a logical, systematic search for the source of a problem in order to solve it, and make the product or process operational again.  Troubleshooting is needed to identify the symptoms.  Determining the most likely cause is a process of elimination—eliminating potential causes of a problem.  Finally, troubleshooting requires confirmation that the solution restores the product or process to its working state. A strategy is an organized set of activities expressing a plausible way of achieving a goal. Strategies should not be viewed as algorithms, inflexibly followed to solutions. Problem solvers behave opportunistically, adjusting activities within a strategy and changing strategies and tactics in response to information and ideas.\n\n\n== Diagnostics ==\nIn general, troubleshooting is the identification or diagnosis of \"trouble\" in the management flow of a system caused by a failure of some kind.  The problem is initially described as symptoms of malfunction, and troubleshooting is the process of determining and remedying the causes of these symptoms. \nA system can be described in terms of its expected, desired or intended behavior (usually, for artificial systems, its purpose).  Events or inputs to the system are expected to generate specific results or outputs.  (For example, selecting the \"print\" option from various computer applications is intended to result in a hardcopy emerging from some specific device). Any unexpected or undesirable behavior is a symptom.  Troubleshooting is the process of isolating the specific cause or causes of the symptom.  Frequently the symptom is a failure of the product or process to produce any results. (Nothing was printed, for example). Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failures of a similar kind.\nThe methods of forensic engineering are useful in tracing problems in products or processes, and a wide range of analytical techniques are available to determine the cause or causes of specific failures. Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failure of a similar kind. Preventive action is possible using failure mode and effects (FMEA) and fault tree analysis (FTA) before full-scale production, and these methods can also be used for failure analysis.\nThere are two major elements required to enable a troubleshooting diagnosis to take place - à priori domain knowledge and search strategies. These are interdependent, and here is where we can identify fundamentally two different types of problem, with matching approaches to their diagnosis. Rasmussen suggested there is strategy guided by the characteristics of the correct functioning of the device (topographic strategy), and strategy guided by the characteristics of abnormal functioning (symptomatic strategy). The second is really asking “what’s wrong?” the first is asking “what’s happening?”\nA strategy is an organized set of activities expressing a plausible way of achieving a goal. Strategies should not be viewed as algorithms, inflexibly followed to solutions. Problem solvers behave opportunistically, adjusting activities within a strategy and changing strategies and tactics in response to information and ideas.\nA symptomatic strategy (also known as case-based reasoning, or shallow reasoning) requires à priori domain knowledge that is gleaned from past experience which established connections between symptoms and causes. This knowledge is referred to as shallow, compiled, evidential, history-based as well as case-based knowledge. This is the strategy most associated with diagnosis by experts. Diagnosis of a problem transpires as a rapid recognition process in which symptoms evoke appropriate situation categories. An expert knows the cause by virtue of having previously encountered similar cases. Case-based reasoning is the most powerful strategy, and that used most commonly. However, the strategy won’t work independently with truly novel problems, or where deeper understanding of whatever is taking place is sought.\nA topographic strategy falls into the category of deep reasoning. With deep reasoning, in-depth knowledge of a system is used. Topography in this context means a description or an analysis of a structured entity, showing the relations among its elements.\nAlso known as reasoning from first principles, deep reasoning is applied to novel faults when experience-based approaches aren’t viable. The topographic strategy is therefore linked to à priori domain knowledge that is developed from a more a fundamental understanding of a system, possibly using first-principles knowledge. Such knowledge is referred to as deep, causal or model-based knowledge.\nHoc noted that symptomatic approaches may need to be supported by topographic approaches because symptoms can be defined in diverse terms. The converse is also true – shallow reasoning can be used abductively to generate causal hypotheses, and deductively to evaluate those hypotheses, in a topographical search.\n\n\n== Aspects ==\nUsually troubleshooting is applied to something that has suddenly stopped working, since its previously working state forms the expectations about its continued behavior. So the initial focus is often on recent changes to the system or to the environment in which it exists. (For example, a printer that \"was working when it was plugged in over there\"). However, there is a well known principle that correlation does not imply causality. (For example, the failure of a device shortly after it has been plugged into a different outlet doesn't necessarily mean that the events were related.  The failure could have been a matter of coincidence.) Therefore, troubleshooting demands critical thinking rather than magical thinking.\nIt is useful to consider the common experiences we have with light bulbs.  Light bulbs \"burn out\" more or less at random; eventually the repeated heating and cooling of its filament, and fluctuations in the power supplied to it cause the filament to crack or vaporize.  The same principle applies to most other electronic devices and similar principles apply to mechanical devices.  Some failures are part of the normal wear-and-tear of components in a system.\nThe first basic principle in troubleshooting is to be able to reproduce the problem, at wish.\nSecond basic principle in troubleshooting is to reduce the \"system\" to its simplest form that still show the problem.\nThird basic principle in troubleshooting is to \"know what you are looking for. In other words, to fully understand the way the system is supposed to work, so you can \"spot\" the error when it happens.\nA troubleshooter could check each component in a system one by one, substituting known good components for each potentially suspect one.  However, this process of \"serial substitution\" can be considered degenerate when components are substituted without regard to a hypothesis concerning how their failure could result in the symptoms being diagnosed.\nSimple and intermediate systems are characterized by lists or trees of dependencies among their components or subsystems.  More complex systems contain cyclical dependencies or interactions (feedback loops).  Such systems are less amenable to \"bisection\" troubleshooting techniques.\nIt also helps to start from a known good state, the best example being a computer reboot.  A cognitive walkthrough is also a good thing to try.  Comprehensive documentation produced by proficient technical writers is very helpful, especially if it provides a theory of operation for the subject device or system.\nA common cause of problems is bad design, for example bad human factors design, where a device could be inserted backward or upside down due to the lack of an appropriate forcing function (behavior-shaping constraint), or a lack of error-tolerant design.  This is especially bad if accompanied by habituation, where the user just doesn't notice the incorrect usage, for instance if two parts have different functions but share a common case so that it is not apparent on a casual inspection which part is being used.\nTroubleshooting can also take the form of a systematic checklist, troubleshooting procedure, flowchart or table that is made before a problem occurs. Developing troubleshooting procedures in advance allows sufficient thought about the steps to take in troubleshooting and organizing the troubleshooting into the most efficient troubleshooting process. Troubleshooting tables can be computerized to make them more efficient for users.\nSome computerized troubleshooting services (such as Primary, later renamed Manesar), immediately show the top 10 solutions with the highest probability of fixing the underlying problem. The technician can either answer additional questions to advance through the troubleshooting procedure, each step narrowing the list of solutions, or immediately implement the solution he feels will fix the problem. These services give a rebate if the technician takes an additional step after the problem is solved: report back the solution that actually fixed the problem. The computer uses these reports to update its estimates of which solutions have the highest probability of fixing that particular set of symptoms.\n\n\n== Half-splitting ==\nEfficient methodical troubleshooting starts on with a clear understanding of the expected behavior of the system and the symptoms being observed.  From there the troubleshooter forms hypotheses on potential causes, and devises (or perhaps references a standardized checklist of) tests to eliminate these prospective causes.  This approach is often called \"divide and conquer\".\nTwo common strategies used by troubleshooters are to check for frequently encountered or easily tested conditions first (for example, checking to ensure that a printer's light is on and that its cable is firmly seated at both ends). This is often referred to as \"milking the front panel.\"\nThen, \"bisect\" the system (for example in a network\nprinting system, checking to see if the job reached the server to determine whether a problem exists in the subsystems \"towards\" the user's end or \"towards\" the device).\nThis latter technique can be particularly efficient in systems with long chains of serialized dependencies or interactions among its components.  It is simply the application of a binary search across the range of dependencies and is often referred to as \"half-splitting\". It is similar to the game of \"twenty questions\":  Anyone can isolate one option out of a million by dividing the set of alternatives in half 20 times (because 2^10 = 1024 and 2^20 = 1,048,576).\n\n\n== Reproducing symptoms ==\nOne of the core principles of troubleshooting is that reproducible problems can be reliably isolated and resolved.  Often considerable effort and emphasis in troubleshooting is placed on reproducibility ... on finding a procedure to reliably induce the symptom to occur.\n\n\n== Intermittent symptoms ==\nSome of the most difficult troubleshooting issues relate to symptoms which occur intermittently.  In electronics this often is the result of components that are thermally sensitive (since resistance of a circuit varies with the temperature of the conductors in it).  Compressed air can be used to cool specific spots on a circuit board and a heat gun can be used to raise the temperatures; thus troubleshooting of electronics systems frequently entails applying these tools in order to reproduce a problem.\nIn computer programming race conditions often lead to intermittent symptoms which are extremely difficult to reproduce; various techniques can be used to force the particular function or module to be called more rapidly than it would be in normal operation (analogous to \"heating up\" a component in a hardware circuit) while other techniques can be used to introduce greater delays in, or force synchronization among, other modules or interacting processes.\nIntermittent issues can be thus defined:\n\nAn intermittent is a problem for which there is no known procedure to consistently reproduce its symptom.\nIn particular he asserts that there is a distinction between the frequency of occurrence and a \"known procedure to consistently reproduce\" an issue.  For example, knowing that an intermittent problem occurs \" within\" an hour of a particular stimulus or event ... but that sometimes it happens in five minutes and other times it takes almost an hour ... does not constitute a \"known procedure\" even if the stimulus does increase the frequency of observable exhibitions of the symptom.\nNevertheless, sometimes troubleshooters must resort to statistical methods ... and can only find procedures to increase the symptom's occurrence to a point at which serial substitution or some other technique is feasible.  In such cases, even when the symptom seems to disappear for significantly longer periods, there is a low confidence that the root cause has been found and that the problem is truly solved.\nAlso, tests may be run to stress certain components to determine if those components have failed.\n\n\n== Multiple problems ==\nIsolating single component failures that cause reproducible symptoms is relatively straightforward.\nHowever, many problems only occur as a result of multiple failures or errors.  This is particularly true of fault tolerant systems, or those with built-in redundancy.  Features that add redundancy, fault detection and failover to a system may also be subject to failure, and enough different component failures in any system will \"take it down.\"\nEven in simple systems, the troubleshooter must always consider the possibility that there is more than one fault.  (Replacing each component, using serial substitution, and then swapping each new component back out for the old one when the symptom is found to persist, can fail to resolve such cases.  More importantly, the replacement of any component with a defective one can actually increase the number of problems rather than eliminating them).\nNote that, while we talk about \"replacing components\" the resolution of many problems involves adjustments or tuning rather than \"replacement.\" For example, intermittent breaks in conductors --- or \"dirty or loose contacts\" might simply need to be cleaned and/or tightened.   All discussion of \"replacement\" should be taken to mean \"replacement or adjustment or other modification.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n5 Whys\nBathtub curve\nCause and effect\nDebugging\nForensic engineering\nNo Trouble Found\nProblem solving\nRoot cause analysis\nRPR Problem Diagnosis\n\n\n== References ==",

        "content": "A sump pump is a pump used to remove water that has accumulated in a water-collecting sump basin, commonly found in the basements of homes and other buildings, and in other locations where water must be removed, such as construction sites.  The water may enter via the perimeter drains of a basement waterproofing system funneling into the basin, or because of rain or natural ground water seepage if the basement is below the water table level.\nMore generally, a \"sump\" is any local depression where water may accumulate. For example, many industrial cooling towers have a built-in sump where a pool of water is used to supply water spray nozzles higher in the tower. Sump pumps are used in industrial plants, construction sites, mines, power plants, military installations, transportation facilities, or anywhere that water can accumulate.\n\n\n== Description ==\nSump pumps are used where basement flooding may otherwise happen, and to solve dampness where the water table is near or above the foundation of a structure. Sump pumps send water away from a location to any place where it is no longer problematic, such as a municipal storm drain, a dry well, or simply an open-air site downhill from the building (sometimes called \"pumping to daylight\").\nPumps may discharge to the sanitary sewer in older installations. Once considered acceptable, this practice may now violate the plumbing code or municipal bylaws, because it can overwhelm the municipal sewage treatment system. Municipalities urge building owners to disconnect and reroute sump pump discharge away from sanitary sewers. Fines may be imposed for noncompliance. Many homeowners have inherited their sump pump configurations and do not realize that their pump discharges into the sanitary sewer.\nSump pump systems are also utilized in industrial and commercial applications to control water table-related problems in surface soil. An artesian aquifer or periodic high water table situation can cause the ground to become unstable due to water saturation. As long as the pump functions, the surface soil will remain stable. These sumps are typically ten feet in depth or more; lined with corrugated metal pipe that contains perforations or drain holes throughout. They may include electronic control systems with visual and audible alarms and are usually covered to prevent debris and animals from falling in.\n\n\n== Power ==\nSump pumps may be plugged into an electrical power receptacle. In this case, it is safer to use a dedicated circuit, which is less likely to lose power from a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker. In addition, the dedicated circuit may not require GFCI protection, as it is less vulnerable to false tripping due to electrical noise, especially during thunderstorms. The dedicated circuit receptacle may be specially labeled to warn against unplugging the pump, or the plug may be attached using a special retaining bracket to discourage unplugging. Instead, the pump may be hardwired to electrical power, so that it cannot be unplugged.\nSince a sump basin may overflow if not pumped, a backup system is important for cases when the main power is out for prolonged periods of time, as during a severe storm.\nSome sump pumps can be automatically powered from a battery backup system, or a separate battery-powered system may be installed, typically with its float switch set slightly higher than the float switch of the primary pump.\nUsing a separate generator is another option. These do often require a manual setup.\nAlternatively, the municipal pressurized water supply powers some pumps, which can operate using a water turbine, or by using the Venturi effect. This design eliminates the need for electricity but consumes potable water, potentially making it more expensive to operate than electrical pumps and creating an additional water disposal problem. This design is used more for backup pumps rather than primary pumps.\nThe main thing to check with the alternative backup electricity sources is whether they offer enough power.\nSump pumps tend to require at least 230 volts although smaller models in the United States can sometimes run on 120 volts. Similarly, watt and amp needs of sump pumps can vary. Consumer models can vary from 700 running watts to 2300 watts and more. Gallons per watt-hour is a measure of efficiency in sump pumps.\nAdditionally, sump pumps will typically require an extra burst of power known as additional starting watts to get running. This can be as much as 1.5 times and more than the running watt and amp needs.\nIndustrial sump pumps may be powered by other means, such a steam or compressed air, especially for backup pumps or in locations where access for maintenance is difficult.\n\n\n== Physical configuration ==\n\nThere are generally two types of residential sump pumps: pedestal and submersible. In the case of the pedestal pump, the motor is not sealed and sits on a column to protect it from moisture. This type of installation is more conspicuous since the motor is usually positioned above the top of the basin. Within the column, the motor shaft is connected to the impeller, which rotates inside a scroll housing at the bottom of the basin. A switch mounted in the motor turns the motor on as the water level in the basin rises, and shuts it off when the basin is empty; this automatic level control permits operation of the pump without constant monitoring. In a submersible pump, the motor is sealed in a special housing, with the impeller mounted directly to the shaft. Automatic level control can be integrated within the pump, or as an auxiliary switch with little or no physical connection to the pump.\nWhich type of sump pump to use is a matter of personal choice. Pedestal sump pumps were the only option through most of the 20th Century, with cast iron and bronze construction similar to large commercial pumps. But technological and design improvements made submersible pumps much more reliable, and the compact design allows the basin to be covered, eliminating a trip and fall hazard, and reducing the potential of radon intrusion in the home. Since the level control switch is the primary point of failure with any sump pump, submersible pumps with auxiliary, or \"piggyback\", designs allow for replacement of the switch with minimal effort. Today, submersible pumps are the most popular style, while residential pedestal pumps are low volume, economical designs with limited service life.\n\n\n== Components ==\nIn the United States, modern sump pump components are standardized. They consist of:\n\nA basin, made of composite materials like ABS plastic or fiberglass reinforced resin, with a minimum inside diameter of 18 inches, and a minimum depth of 30 inches, and an inlet connection to accommodate a 4\" drainpipe, an approximately 15 to 25 US gallons (60 to 100 litre) capacity;\nA sump pump, either 1/3 or 1/2 horsepower (250 or 370 W), operates on 115 volts, plugs into a standard receptacle. Pipe connections are either 1.25\" or 1.5\", National Pipe Thread (NPT), and a level control to allow for automatic operation;\nA section of pipe to carry water away from the home; manufactured from steel, iron, or plastic, National Sanitation Foundation (or NSF) rated for pressure;\nA one-way valve (check valve) that allows water to flow away from the basin, but prevents water in the pipe from returning to the basin.\nA basin cover that provides passage for the power cord, discharge pipe, and possibly a vent pipe.\n\n\n== Pump selection ==\nSelection of a sump pump may consider:\n\nAutomatic vs. manual operation – pump may be controlled automatically by a level switch.\nPower – Sump pump motive power will vary from 1/4 horsepower to multiple horsepower.\nHead pressure – The hydraulic head pressure of a sump pump describes the maximum height to which the pump will move water. For instance, a sump pump with a 15 feet (4.6 m) maximum head (also called a shutoff head) will raise water up 15 feet (4.6 m) before it completely loses flow.\nPower cord length – Running a more powerful electrical motor a long distance from the main service panel will require heavier gauge wiring to assure sufficient voltage at the motor for proper pump performance.\nPhase and voltage – Sump pumps powered from the AC mains are available with single-phase or three-phase induction motors, rated for 110–120, 220–240, or 460 volts. Three-phase power is typically not available in residential locations, but is common in industrial locations.\nWater level sensing switch type – Pressure switches are fully enclosed, usually inside the pump body, making them immune to obstructions or floating debris in the sump basin. Float switches, particularly the types attached to the end of a short length of flexible electrical cable, can get tangled or obstructed, especially if the pump is prone to movement in the basin due to torque effects when starting and stopping. Pressure switches are typically factory set and not adjustable, while float switches can be adjusted in place to set the high and low water levels in the sump basin. Another option is a solid state switch utilizing field-effect technology, which can turn on and off the pump through use of an internal switch and a piggyback plug.\nBackup system and alarm for critical applications.\n\n\n== Backup components ==\n\nA secondary, typically battery-powered sump pump can operate if the first pump fails. A battery-powered secondary pump will have a separate battery and charger system to provide power if normal supply is interrupted.\nAlternative sump pump systems can be driven by municipal water pressure. Water-powered ejector pumps have  a separate pump, float and check valve. The float controlling a backup pump is mounted in the sump pit above the normal high water mark. Under normal conditions, the main electric powered sump pump will handle all the pumping duties. When water rises higher than normal for any reason, the backup float in the sump is lifted and activates the backup sump pump. An ejector pump can also be connected to a garden hose to supply high-pressure water, with another hose to carry the water away.  Although such ejector pumps waste water and are relatively inefficient, they have the advantage of having no moving parts and offer the utmost in reliability.\nIf the backup sump system is rarely used, a component failure may not be noticed, and the system may fail when needed. Some battery control units test the system periodically and alert on failed electrical components.\nA simple, battery-powered water alarm can be hung a short distance below the top of the sump to sound an alarm should the water level rise too high. The alarm may sound locally only, or optionally may trigger remote notification via a telephone or cellphone data link.\n\n\n== Maintenance ==\n\nSump basins and sump pumps must be maintained. Typical recommendations suggest examining and testing equipment every year. Pumps running frequently due to higher water table, water drainage, or weather conditions should be examined more frequently. Sump pumps, being mechanical devices, will fail eventually, which could lead to a flooded basement and costly repairs. Redundancy in the system (multiple/secondary pumps) can help to avoid problems when maintenance and repairs are needed on the primary system.\nWhen examining a sump pump and cleaning it, dirt, gravel, sand, and other loose debris should be removed to increase efficiency and extend the life of the pump. These obstructions can decrease the pump's ability to drain the sump, and can allow the sump to overflow. The check valve can also jam from the debris. Periodic examination of the discharge line opening, when applicable, ensures there are no obstructions or restrictions in the line. A partially obstructed discharge line can force a sump pump to work harder and increase its chance of overheating and failure.\nFloat switches are used to automatically turn the sump pump on when water rises to a preset level. Float switches must be kept clear of any obstructions within the sump.  A float guard can be used to prevent the float switch from accidentally resting on the pump housing, and remaining on. If a sump pump remains operating for a long time (especially in the absence of cooling water for submersibles) it may overheat or burn out. Because mechanical float switches can wear out, they should be periodically tested by actuating them manually to assure that they continue to move freely and that the switch contacts are opening and closing properly.\nIf left in standing water, pedestal pumps should be manually run from time to time, even if the water in the sump is not high enough to trip the float switch. This is because these pumps are incapable of removing all the water in a sump, and the lower bearing or bushing for the pump impeller shaft tends to remain submerged, making it prone to corrosion and eventually freezing the drive shaft in the bearing. In the alternative, a pedestal pump that is expected to remain idle for an extended time should be removed from the sump and stored out of water, or the sump should be mopped out to bring the level of the remaining water well below the lower shaft bearing.\nLastly, if an independent water detector and alarm system is installed, it should be tested regularly.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBilge pump\nChopper pump\nSewage pump\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nAnn Cameron Siegal, \"The Sump Pump's Fault, or Yours?\", Washington Post, August 9, 2008\n\"Sump Pump Helps Keep Water Out\", North Dakota State University Extension Service, June 14, 2005\nThomas Scherer, \"Sump Pump Questions\", North Dakota State University Extension Service\n\"Sizing Up a Sump Pump\" (pdf), University of Illinois Extension",

Originally made for the workstation, office, and server markets, the Windows NT line was made available to consumers with the release of Windows XP in 2001. The underlying technology of Windows NT continues to exist to this day with incremental changes and improvements, with the latest version of Windows based on Windows NT being Windows Server 2025 announced in 2024.\nThe name \"Windows NT\" originally denoted the major technological advancements that it had introduced to the Windows product line, including eliminating the 16-bit memory access limitations of earlier Windows releases such as Windows 3.1. Each Windows release built on this technology is considered to be based on, if not a revision of Windows NT, even though the Windows NT name itself has not been used in any other Windows releases since Windows NT 4.0 in 1996.\nWindows NT provides many more features than other Windows releases, among them being support for multiprocessing, multi-user systems, a \"pure\" 32-bit kernel with 32-bit memory addressing, support for instruction sets other than x86, and many other system services such as Active Directory and more. Newer versions of Windows NT support 64-bit computing, with a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit memory addressing.\n\n\n== Product line ==\nWindows NT is a group or family of products—like Windows is a group or family. Windows NT is a sub-grouping of Windows.\nThe first version of Windows NT, 3.1, was produced for workstation and server computers. It was commercially focused—and intended to complement consumer versions of Windows that were based on MS-DOS (including Windows 1.0 through Windows 3.1x). In 1996, Windows NT 4.0 was released, including the new shell from Windows 95.\nEventually, Microsoft incorporated the Windows NT technology into the Windows product line for personal computing and deprecated the Windows 9x family. Starting with Windows 2000, \"NT\" was removed from the product name yet is still in several low-level places in the system—including for a while as part of the product version.\n\n\n== Installing ==\nVersions of Windows NT are installed using Windows Setup, which, starting with Windows Vista, uses the Windows Preinstallation Environment, which is a lightweight version of Windows NT made for deployment of the operating system.\nSince Windows Vista, the Windows installation files, as well as the preinstallation environment used to install Windows, are stored in the Windows Imaging Format. It is possible to use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to install Windows from the command line and skip the GUI installer.\n\n\n== Naming ==\nIt has been suggested that Dave Cutler intended the initialism \"WNT\" as a play on VMS, incrementing each letter by one. However, the project was originally intended as a follow-on to OS/2 and was referred to as \"NT OS/2\" before receiving the Windows brand. Two of the original NT developers, Mark Lucovsky and Dave W. Plummer, state that the name was taken from the original target processor—the Intel i860, code-named N10 (\"N-Ten\"). A 1991 video featuring Bill Gates and Microsoft products specifically says that \"Windows NT stands for 'New Technology'\". Seven years later in 1998, during a question-and-answer (Q&A) session, he then revealed that the letters were previously expanded to such but no longer carry any specific meaning. The letters were dropped from the names of releases from Windows 2000 and later, though Microsoft described that product as being \"Built on NT Technology\".\n\"NT\" was a trademark of Northern Telecom (later Nortel), which Microsoft was forced to acknowledge on the product packaging.\n\n\n== Major features ==\nOne of the main purposes of NT is hardware and software portability. Various versions of NT family operating systems have been released for a variety of processor architectures, initially IA-32, MIPS, and DEC Alpha, with PowerPC, Itanium, x86-64 and ARM supported in later releases. An initial idea was to have a common code base with a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for each platform. However, support for MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC was later dropped in Windows 2000. Broad software compatibility was initially achieved with support for several API \"personalities\", including Windows API, POSIX, and OS/2 APIs—the latter two were phased out starting with Windows XP. Partial MS-DOS and Windows 16-bit compatibility is achieved on IA-32 via an integrated DOS Virtual Machine—although this feature is not available on other architectures.\nNT has supported per-object (file, function, and role) access control lists allowing a rich set of security permissions to be applied to systems and services. NT\nhas also supported Windows network protocols, inheriting the previous OS/2 LAN Manager networking, as well as TCP/IP networking (for which Microsoft used to implement a TCP/IP stack derived at first from a STREAMS-based stack from Spider Systems, then later rewritten in-house).\nWindows NT 3.1 was the first version of Windows to use 32-bit flat virtual memory addressing on 32-bit processors. Its companion product, Windows 3.1, used segmented addressing and switches from 16-bit to 32-bit addressing in pages.\nWindows NT 3.1 featured a core kernel providing a system API, running in supervisor mode (ring 0 in x86; referred to in Windows NT as \"kernel mode\" on all platforms), and a set of user-space environments with their own APIs which included the new Win32 environment, an OS/2 1.3 text-mode environment and a POSIX environment. The full preemptive multitasking kernel could interrupt running tasks to schedule other tasks, without relying on user programs to voluntarily give up control of the CPU, as in Windows 3.1 Windows applications (although MS-DOS applications were preemptively multitasked in Windows starting with Windows/386).\nNotably, in Windows NT 3.x, several I/O driver subsystems, such as video and printing, were user-mode subsystems. In Windows NT 4.0, the video, server, and printer spooler subsystems were moved into kernel mode. Windows NT's first GUI was strongly influenced by (and programmatically compatible with) that from Windows 3.1; Windows NT 4.0's interface was redesigned to match that of the brand-new Windows 95, moving from the Program Manager to the Windows shell design.\nNTFS, a journaled, secure file system, is a major feature of NT. Windows NT also allows for other installable file systems; NT can also be installed on FAT file systems, and versions 3.1, 3.5, and 3.51 could be installed on HPFS file systems.\nWindows NT introduced its own driver model, the Windows NT driver model, and is incompatible with older driver frameworks. With Windows 2000, the Windows NT driver model was enhanced to become the Windows Driver Model, which was first introduced with Windows 98, but was based on the NT driver model. Windows Vista added native support for the Windows Driver Foundation, which is also available for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and to an extent, Windows 2000.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nMicrosoft decided to create a portable operating system, compatible with OS/2 and POSIX and supporting multiprocessing, in October 1988. When development started in November 1989, Windows NT was to be known as OS/2 3.0, the third version of the operating system developed jointly by Microsoft and IBM. To ensure portability, initial development was targeted at the Intel i860XR RISC processor, switching to the MIPS R3000 in late 1989, and then the Intel i386 in 1990. Microsoft also continued parallel development of the DOS-based and less resource-demanding Windows environment, resulting in the release of Windows 3.0 in May 1990.\nWindows 3.0 was eventually so successful that Microsoft decided to change the primary application programming interface for the still unreleased NT OS/2 (as it was then known) from an extended OS/2 API to an extended Windows API. This decision caused tension between Microsoft and IBM and the collaboration ultimately fell apart.\nIBM continued OS/2 development alone while Microsoft continued work on the newly renamed Windows NT. Though neither operating system would immediately be as popular as Microsoft's MS-DOS or Windows products, Windows NT would eventually be far more successful than OS/2.\nMicrosoft hired a group of developers from Digital Equipment Corporation led by Dave Cutler to build Windows NT, and many elements of the design reflect earlier DEC experience with Cutler's VMS, VAXELN and RSX-11, but also an unreleased object-based operating system developed by Cutler at Digital codenamed MICA. The team was joined by selected members of the disbanded OS/2 team, including Moshe Dunie.\n\nAlthough NT was not an exact clone of Cutler's previous operating systems, DEC engineers almost immediately noticed the internal similarities. Parts of VAX/VMS Internals and Data Structures, published by Digital Press, accurately describe Windows NT internals using VMS terms. Furthermore, parts of the NT codebase's directory structure and filenames matched that of the MICA codebase. Instead of a lawsuit, Microsoft agreed to pay DEC $65–100 million, help market VMS, train Digital personnel on Windows NT, and continue Windows NT support for the DEC Alpha.\nWindows NT and VMS memory management, processes, and scheduling are very similar. Windows NT's process management differs by implementing threading, which DEC did not implement until VMS 7.0 in 1995.\nLike VMS, Windows NT's kernel mode code distinguishes between the \"kernel\", whose primary purpose is to implement processor- and architecture-dependent functions, and the \"executive\". This was designed as a modified microkernel, as the Windows NT kernel was influenced by the Mach microkernel developed by Richard Rashid at Carnegie Mellon University, but does not meet all of the criteria of a pure microkernel. Both the kernel and the executive are linked together into the single loaded module ntoskrnl.exe; from outside this module, there is little distinction between the kernel and the executive. Routines from each are directly accessible, as for example from kernel-mode device drivers.\nAPI sets in the Windows NT family are implemented as subsystems atop the publicly undocumented \"native\" API; this allowed the late adoption of the Windows API (into the Win32 subsystem). Windows NT was one of the earliest operating systems to use UCS-2 and UTF-16 internally.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nWindows NT uses a layered design architecture that consists of two main components, user mode and kernel mode. Programs and subsystems in user mode are limited in terms of what system resources they have access to, while the kernel mode has unrestricted access to the system memory and external devices. Kernel mode in Windows NT has full access to the hardware and system resources of the computer. The Windows NT kernel is a hybrid kernel; the architecture comprises a simple kernel, hardware abstraction layer (HAL), drivers, and a range of services (collectively named Executive), which all exist in kernel mode.\nThe booting process of Windows NT begins with NTLDR in versions before Vista and the Windows Boot Manager in Vista and later. The boot loader is responsible for accessing the file system on the boot drive, starting the kernel, and loading boot-time device drivers into memory. Once all the boot and system drivers have been loaded, the kernel starts the Session Manager Subsystem. This process launches winlogon, which allows the user to login. Once the user is logged in File Explorer is started, loading the graphical user interface of Windows NT.\n\n\n=== Programming language ===\nWindows NT is written in C and C++, with a very small amount written in assembly language. C is mostly used for the kernel code while C++ is mostly used for user-mode code. Assembly language is avoided where possible because it would impede portability.\n\n\n== Releases ==\n\nThe following are the releases of Windows based on the Windows NT technology.\n\nWindows NT 3.1 to 3.51 incorporated the Program Manager and File Manager from the Windows 3.1 series. Windows NT 4.0 onwards replaced those programs with Windows Explorer (including a taskbar and Start menu), which originally appeared in Windows 95.\nThe first release was given version number 3.1 to match the contemporary 16-bit Windows; magazines of that era claimed the number was also used to make that version seem more reliable than a \".0\" release. Also the Novell IPX protocol was apparently licensed only to 3.1 versions of Windows software.\nThe NT version number is not now generally used for marketing purposes, but is still used internally, and said to reflect the degree of changes to the core of the operating system. However, for application compatibility reasons, Microsoft kept the major version number as 6 in releases following Vista, but changed it later to 10 in Windows 10. The build number is an internal identifier used by Microsoft's developers and beta testers.\nStarting with Windows 8.1, Microsoft changed the Version API Helper functions' behavior. If an application is not manifested for Windows 8.1 or later, the API will always return version 6.2, which is the version number of Windows 8. This is because the manifest feature was introduced with Windows 8.1, to replace GetVersion and related functions.\n\n\n== Supported platforms ==\n\n\n=== 32-bit platforms ===\nIn order to prevent Intel x86-specific code from slipping into the operating system, due to developers being used to developing on x86 chips, Windows NT 3.1 was initially developed using non-x86 development systems and then ported to the x86 architecture. This work was initially based on the Intel i860-based Dazzle system and, later, the MIPS R4000-based Jazz platform. Both systems were designed internally at Microsoft.\nWindows NT 3.1 was released for Intel x86 PC compatible and PC-98 platforms, and for DEC Alpha and ARC-compliant MIPS platforms. Windows NT 3.51 added support for the PowerPC processor in 1995, specifically PReP-compliant systems such as the IBM ThinkPad Power Series laptops and Motorola PowerStack series; but despite meetings between Michael Spindler and Bill Gates, not on the Power Macintosh as the PReP compliant Power Macintosh project failed to ship.\nIntergraph Corporation ported Windows NT to its Clipper architecture and later announced an intention to port Windows NT 3.51 to Sun Microsystems' SPARC architecture, in conjunction with the company's planned introduction of UltraSPARC models in 1995, but neither version was sold to the public as a retail product.\nOnly two of the Windows NT 4.0 variants (IA-32 and Alpha) have a full set of service packs available. All of the other ports done by third parties (Motorola, Intergraph, etc.) have few, if any, publicly available updates.\nWindows NT 4.0 was the last major release to support Alpha, MIPS, or PowerPC, though development of Windows 2000 for Alpha continued until August 1999, when Compaq stopped support for Windows NT on that architecture; and then three days later Microsoft also canceled their AlphaNT program, even though the Alpha NT 5 (Windows 2000) release had reached RC1 status.\nOn January 5, 2011, Microsoft announced that the next major version of the Windows NT family will include support for the ARM architecture. Microsoft demonstrated a preliminary version of Windows (version 6.2.7867) running on an ARM-based computer at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show. This eventually led to the commercial release of the Windows 8-derived Windows RT on October 26, 2012, and the use of Windows NT, rather than Windows CE, in Windows Phone 8.\nThe original Xbox and Xbox 360 run a custom operating system based upon a heavily modified version of Windows 2000, an approach that Microsoft engineer Don Box called \"fork and run\". It exports APIs similar to those found in Microsoft Windows, such as Direct3D. The Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S consoles use a stripped-down version of the Windows operating system.\nWindows 11 is the first non-server version of Windows NT that does not support 32-bit platforms.\n\n\n=== 64-bit platforms ===\nThe 64-bit versions of Windows NT were originally intended to run on Itanium and DEC Alpha; the latter was used internally at Microsoft during early development of 64-bit Windows. This continued for some time after Microsoft publicly announced that it was cancelling plans to ship 64-bit Windows for Alpha. Because of this, Alpha versions of Windows NT are 32-bit only.\nWhile Windows 2000 only supports Intel IA-32 (32-bit), Windows XP, Server 2003, Server 2008 and Server 2008 R2 each have one edition dedicated to Itanium-based systems. In comparison with Itanium, Microsoft adopted x64 on a greater scale: every version of Windows since Windows XP (which has a dedicated x64 edition) has x64 editions.\nThe first version of Windows NT to support ARM64 devices with Qualcomm processors was Windows 10, version 1709. This is a full version of Windows, rather than the cut-down Windows RT.\n\n\n== Hardware requirements ==\nThe minimum hardware specification required to run each release of the professional workstation version of Windows NT has been fairly slow-moving until the 6.0 (Vista) release, which requires a minimum of 15 GB of free disk space, a tenfold increase in free disk space alone over the previous version, and the 2021 10.0 (11) release which excludes most systems built before 2018.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWindows domain\nReactOS (an open source project with the goal of providing binary- and device driver-level compatibility with Windows NT)\nWindows Preinstallation Environment\nMicrosoft Servers\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWindows (official page), Microsoft.\nRussinovich, Mark, \"Windows NT and VMS: The Rest of the Story\", Win 2000 (discussion of ancestry of NT), archived from the original on May 3, 2002.\nA Brief History of the Windows NT Operating System (fact sheet), Microsoft PressPass, 1998, archived from the original on June 10, 2004.",
